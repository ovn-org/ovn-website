Release Notes:
```
OVN v24.09.0 - 13 Sep 2024
--------------------------
  - Added a new logical switch port option "pkt_clone_type".
    If the value is set to "mc_unknown", packets destined to the port gets
    cloned to all unknown ports connected to the same Logical Switch.
  - Added a new logical switch port option "disable_arp_nd_rsp" to
    disable adding the ARP responder flows if set to true.
  - IGMP_Group has new "protocol" column that displays the the group
    protocol version.
  - Add ovn-debug tool containing two commands.
    "lflow-stage-to-ltable STAGE_NAME" that converts stage name into logical
    flow table id.
    "lflow-stage-to-oftable STAGE_NAME" that converts stage name into OpenFlow
    table id.
  - Rename the ovs-sandbox script to ovn-sandbox.
  - Remove "ovn-set-local-ip" config option from vswitchd
    external-ids, the option is no longer needed as it became effectively
    "true" for all scenarios.
  - Added DHCPv4 relay support.
  - A new LSP option "force_fdb_lookup" has been added to ensure the additional
    MAC addresses configured on the LSP with "unknown", are learnt via the
    OVN native FDB.
  - Add support for ovsdb-server `--config-file` option in ovn-ctl.
  - Add "ovn-bridge-remote" config option to vswitchd external-ids,
    that allows to specify connection method to management bridge for
    ovn-controller, defaulting to the unix socket.
  - Add "ovn-bridge-remote-probe-interval" config option to vswitchd
    external-ids, that sets probe interval for integration bridge connection,
    disabled by default.
  - The "options:ic-route-blacklist" option in the Northbound NB_Global table
    has been renamed to "options:ic-route-denylist" in order to comply with
    inclusive language guidelines. The previous name is still recognized to
    aid with backwards compatibility.
  - NATs can now be given an arbitrary match condition and priority. This
    allows for conditional NATs to be configured. See the ovn-nb(5) man
    page for more information.
  - Added new global config option NB_Global:options:vxlan_mode to support
    ability to disable "VXLAN mode" to extend available tunnel IDs space for
    datapaths from 4095 to 16711680.  For more details see man ovn-nb(5) for
    mentioned option.
  - Added new global config option NB_Global:options:always_tunnel.  If set to
    true, the traffic destined to a logical port of a provider logical switch
    (having a localnet port) will be tunnelled instead of sending it via the
    localnet port.
  - Added support to define boundaries (min and max values) for selected ct
    zones.
  - Add support for CT zone limit that can be specified per LR
    (options:ct-zone-limit), LS (other_config:ct-zone-limit) or LSP
    (options:ct-zone-limit).
  - A new LSP option "disable_garp_rarp" has been added to prevent OVN from
    sending GARP or RARP announcements when a VIF is created on a bridged
    logical switch.
  - A new LRP option 'centralize_routing' has been added to a
    distributed gateway port to centralize routing if the logical
    switch of its peer doesn't have a localnet port.
  - The NB_Global.debug_drop_domain_id configured value is now overridden by
    the ID associated with the Sampling_App record created for drop sampling
    (Sampling_App.type configured as "drop").
  - Add support for ACL sampling through the new Sample_Collector and Sample
    tables.  Sampling is supported for both traffic that creates new
    connections and for traffic that is part of an existing connection.
  - Add "external_ids:ovn-encap-ip-default" config for ovn-controller to
    determine the default encap IP when there are multiple encap IPs
    configured.
  - Added a new column in the southbound database "flow_desc" to provide
    human readable context to flows.
  - Added two new experimental logical router port options,
    "routing-protocol-redirect" and "routing-protocols", that allow
    redirection of routing protocol traffic received by a router port
    to a different logical switch port.
