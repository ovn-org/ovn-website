Release Notes:
```
OVN v25.03.0 - 07 Mar 2025
--------------------------
   - Added support to choose selection methods - dp_hash or
     hash (with specified hash fields) for ECMP routes
     while choosing nexthop.
   - ovn-ic: Add support for route tag to prevent route learning.
   - Support for STT tunnels in ovn-encap-type is deprecated and will be
     removed in the next release.
   - The LRP option 'centralize_routing' has been removed. The behavior is now
     enabled in all cases where it is needed.
   - ovn-nb: Changed schema of ovn-nb to make networks optional within Logical
     Router Ports.
   - Added support for Spine-Leaf topology of logical switches by adding
     a new LSP type 'switch' that can directly connect two logical switches.
     Supported for both distributed and transit switches.
   - Bump python version required for building OVN to 3.7.
   - SSL/TLS:
     * TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 protocols are deprecated and disabled by default
       on OpenFlow and database connections.  Use --ssl-protocols to turn
       them back on.  Support will be fully removed in the next release.
     * OpenSSL 1.1.1 or newer is now required for SSL/TLS support.
     * The protocol list in --ssl-protocols or corresponding database column
       now supports specifying simple protocol ranges like:
         - "TLSv1-TLSv1.2" to enable all protocols between TLSv1 and TLSv1.2.
         - "TLSv1.2+" to enable protocol TLSv1.2 and later.
       The value must be a list of protocols or exactly one protocol range.
     * Added explicit support for TLSv1.3.  It can now be enabled via
       --ssl-protocols (TLSv1.3 was supported in earlier versions only when
       this option was not set).  TLS ciphersuites for TLSv1.3 and later can
       be configured via --ssl-ciphersuites (--ssl-ciphers only applies to
       TLSv1.2 and earlier).
   - Add "arp-nd-max-timeout-sec" config option to vswitchd external-ids to
     configure the interval (in seconds) between ovn-controller originated
     ARP/ND packets used for tracking ECMP next hop MAC addresses.
   - Auto flush ECMP symmetric reply connection states when an ECMP route is
     removed by the CMS.  This behavior is controlled by the
     "ecmp_nexthop_monitor_enable" config option in the NB_Global table.
     Disabled by default.
   - Improved handling of IPv6 traffic by enabling address prefix tracking
     in OVS for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, whenever possible, reducing
     the amount of IPv6 datapath flows.
   - Add concept of Transit Routers, users are now allowed to specify
     options:requested-chassis for router ports; if the chassis is remote
     then the router port will behave as a remote port.
   - Added a new ACL option "persist-established" that allows for
     established connections to bypass ACL matching. This way, if an ACL
     match changes, traffic on the established connection can still pass.
   - Logical router policies can now be arranged in chains. Using the new
     "jump" action, combined with new "chain" and "jump_chain" columns,
     allows for policies to be chained together.
   - Reduce the max number of local datapath to 1024 when OVN is using VXLAN
     encapsulation type in OVN-interconnect mode.
   - Added vxlan_mode parameter in IC_NB_GLOBAL option column to enable or
     disable VXLAN encapsulation type in OVN-interconnect mode.
   - Dynamic Routing:
     * Add the option "dynamic-routing" to Logical Routers. If set to true
       static and connected routes matching the filter below are shared to the
       southbound "Advertised_Route" table for sharing outside of OVN.
       The routes can further be configured by setting
       `dynamic-routing-redistribute` on the LR or LRP. The LRP settings
       overwrite the LR settings for all routes using this interface to
       forward traffic on.
     * Allow Logical Routers to dynamically learn routes from outside the
       fabric. Routes entered into the "Learned_Route" table in the southbound
       database will be learned by the respective LR. They are included in the
       route table with a lower priority than static routes.
     * Add the option value "connected-as-host" to the
       "dynamic-routing-redistribute" LR and LRP option. If set then connected
       routes are announced as individual host routes.
     * Add the option "dynamic-routing-maintain-vrf" to LRPs. If set the
       ovn-controller will create a vrf named "ovnvrf" + datapath id that
       includes all advertised and learned routes.
       The vrf name can be overwritten with the "dynamic-routing-vrf-name"
       setting.
     * Add the option "dynamic-routing-port-name" to LRPs. If set only routes
       learned from a linux interfaces that is locally bound to the referenced
       LSP will be learned. Additionally support local overwrites for arbitrary
       interface names using "dynamic-routing-port-mapping".
     * The logical router port options "routing-protocol-redirect" and
       "routing-protocols" are now also usable on distributed gateway ports.
     * Logical router port options "routing-protocol-redirect" and
       "routing-protocols" are now considered stable. Their "experimental" tag
       was removed.
   - Add "options:ct-commit-all" to LR, that enables commit of all traffic
     to DNAT and SNAT zone when LR is stateful.
