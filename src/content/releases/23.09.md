[Github link](https://github.com/ovn-org/ovn/releases/tag/v23.09.0)

Release Notes:
```
OVN v23.09.0 - 15 Sep 2023
----------------------------
  - Added FDB aging mechanism, that is disabled by default.
    It can be enabled per logical switch with other_config
    "fdb_age_threshold".
  - Add DHCPv6 "fqdn" (39) option, that works similarly to
    DHCPv4 "hostname" (12) option.
  - Support to create/update MAC_Binding when GARP received from VTEP (RAMP)
    switch on l3dgw port.
  - To allow optimizing ovn-controller's monitor conditions for the regular
    VIF case, ovn-controller now unconditionally monitors all sub-ports
    (ports with parent_port set).
  - ECMP routes use L4_SYM dp-hash by default if the datapath supports it.
    Existing sessions might get re-hashed to a different ECMP path when
    OVN detects the algorithm support in the datapath during an upgrade
    or restart of ovn-controller.
  - Add "northd-backoff-interval-ms" config option to delay northd engine
    runs capped at the set value.
  - Add "garp-max-timeout-sec" config option to vswitchd external-ids to
    cap the time between when ovn-controller sends gARP packets.
  - Introduce support for binding remote ports in ovn-northd if the CMS sets
    requested-chassis option for a remote logical switch port.
  - Added support to reply success for DHCPv6 Release messages.
