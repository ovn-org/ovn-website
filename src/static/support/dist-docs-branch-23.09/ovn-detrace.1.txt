ovn-detrace(1)                    OVN Manual                    ovn-detrace(1)

NAME
       ovn-detrace  -  convert  ``ovs-appctl ofproto/trace'' output to combine
       OVN logical flow information.

SYNOPSIS
       ovn-detrace < file

       Common options:
              [-h | --help] [-V | --version]


DESCRIPTION
       The ovn-detrace program reads ovs-appctl ofproto/trace output on stdin,
       looking for flow cookies, and expand each cookie with corresponding OVN
       logical flows. It expands logical flow further with the north-bound inâ€
       formation e.g. the ACL that generated the logical flow, when relevant.

OPTIONS
       -h
       --help Prints a brief help message to the console.

       -V
       --version
              Prints version information to the console.

       --ovnsb=server
              The OVN Southbound DB remote to contact.  If the OVN_SB_DB enviâ€
              ronment variable is set, its value is used as the default.  Othâ€
              erwise, the default is unix:@RUNDIR@/ovnsb_db.sock, but this deâ€
              fault is unlikely to be useful  outside  of  single-machine  OVN
              test environments.

       --ovnnb=server
              The OVN Northbound DB remote to contact.  If the OVN_NB_DB enviâ€
              ronment variable is set, its value is used as the default.  Othâ€
              erwise, the default is unix:@RUNDIR@/ovnnb_db.sock, but this deâ€
              fault  is  unlikely  to  be useful outside of single-machine OVN
              test environments.

       --ovs= Also decode flow information (like OVS ofport) from the flows by
              connecting to the OVS DB.

       --no-leader-only
              Connect to any cluster member, not just the leader.  The  option
              works for OVN Southbound DB and OVN Northbound DB.

       --ovsdb=server
              The  OVS  DB  remote  to  contact  if  --ovs is present.  If the
              OVS_RUNDIR environment variable is set, its value is used as the
              default. Otherwise, the default  is  unix:@RUNDIR@/db.sock,  but
              this  default is unlikely to be useful outside of single-machine
              OVN test environments.

       -p privkey.pem
       --private-key=privkey.pem
              Specifies a PEM file containing the private key used as  ovn-deâ€â€
              trace's identity for outgoing SSL connections.

       -c cert.pem
       --certificate=cert.pem
              Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies the
              private  key specified on -p or --private-key to be trustworthy.
              The certificate must be signed by the certificate authority (CA)
              that the peer in SSL connections will use to verify it.

       -C cacert.pem
       --ca-cert=cacert.pem
              Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate that  ovn-deâ€â€
              trace  should  use to verify certificates presented to it by SSL
              peers.  (This may be the same certificate that SSL peers use  to
              verify  the  certificate specified on -c or --certificate, or it
              may be a different one, depending on the PKI design in use.)
