NAME
       ovn-sb - OVN_Southbound database schema

       This  database  holds  logical and physical configuration and state for
       the Open Virtual Network (OVN) system to support  virtual  network  ab‚Äê
       straction. For an introduction to OVN, please see ovn-architecture(7).

       The OVN Southbound database sits at the center of the OVN architecture.
       It is the one component that speaks both southbound directly to all the
       hypervisors  and  gateways, via ovn-controller/ovn-controller-vtep, and
       northbound to the Cloud Management System, via ovn-northd:

   Database Structure
       The OVN Southbound database contains classes  of  data  with  different
       properties, as described in the sections below.

     Physical network

       Physical  network tables contain information about the chassis nodes in
       the system. This contains all the information  necessary  to  wire  the
       overlay,  such  as  IP  addresses, supported tunnel types, and security
       keys.

       The amount of physical network data is small (O(n)  in  the  number  of
       chassis)  and it changes infrequently, so it can be replicated to every
       chassis.

       The Chassis and Encap tables are the physical network tables.

     Logical Network

       Logical network tables contain the topology  of  logical  switches  and
       routers,  ACLs,  firewall  rules, and everything needed to describe how
       packets traverse a logical network,  represented  as  logical  datapath
       flows (see Logical Datapath Flows, below).

       Logical network data may be large (O(n) in the number of logical ports,
       ACL rules, etc.). Thus, to improve scaling, each chassis should receive
       only  data  related  to logical networks in which that chassis partici‚Äê
       pates.

       The logical network data is ultimately controlled by the cloud  manage‚Äê
       ment  system  (CMS)  running northbound of OVN. That CMS determines the
       entire OVN logical configuration and therefore the logical network data
       at any given time is a deterministic function of the  CMS‚Äôs  configura‚Äê
       tion,  although that happens indirectly via the OVN_Northbound database
       and ovn-northd.

       Logical network data is likely to change  more  quickly  than  physical
       network  data. This is especially true in a container environment where
       containers are created  and  destroyed  (and  therefore  added  to  and
       deleted from logical switches) quickly.

       The   Logical_Flow,   Multicast_Group,   Address_Group,   DHCP_Options,
       DHCPv6_Options, and DNS tables contain logical network data.

     Logical-physical bindings

       These tables link logical and physical components. They show  the  cur‚Äê
       rent  placement of logical components (such as VMs and VIFs) onto chas‚Äê
       sis, and map logical entities to the values that represent them in tun‚Äê
       nel encapsulations.

       These tables change frequently, at least every time a VM powers  up  or
       down  or  migrates,  and especially quickly in a container environment.
       The amount of data per VM (or VIF) is small.

       Each chassis is authoritative about the VMs and VIFs that it  hosts  at
       any  given time and can efficiently flood that state to a central loca‚Äê
       tion, so the consistency needs are minimal.

       The Port_Binding and Datapath_Binding tables contain binding data.

     MAC bindings

       The MAC_Binding table tracks the bindings from IP addresses to Ethernet
       addresses that are dynamically discovered  using  ARP  (for  IPv4)  and
       neighbor  discovery (for IPv6). Usually, IP-to-MAC bindings for virtual
       machines are statically  populated  into  the  Port_Binding  table,  so
       MAC_Binding  is  primarily  used  to discover bindings on physical net‚Äê
       works.

   Common Columns
       Some tables contain a special column named  external_ids.  This  column
       has  the  same  form  and purpose each place that it appears, so we de‚Äê
       scribe it here to save space later.

              external_ids: map of string-string pairs
                     Key-value pairs for use by the software that manages  the
                     OVN   Southbound   database   rather   than  by  ovn-con‚Ä‚Äê
                     troller/ovn-controller-vtep.  In  particular,  ovn-northd
                     can use key-value pairs in this column to relate entities
                     in the southbound database to higher-level entities (such
                     as  entities  in the OVN Northbound database). Individual
                     key-value pairs in this column may be documented in  some
                     cases  to  aid  in understanding and troubleshooting, but
                     the reader should not mistake such documentation as  com‚Äê
                     prehensive.

   Details:
     Status:

       This column allow a client to track the overall configuration state  of
       the system.

       nb_cfg: integer
              Sequence  number  for the configuration. When a CMS or ovn-nbctl
              updates the northbound database, it increments the nb_cfg column
              in the NB_Global table in the northbound database. In turn, when
              ovn-northd updates the southbound database to  bring  it  up  to
              date  with  these  changes,  it  updates this column to the same
              value.

     Common Columns:

       external_ids: map of string-string pairs
              See External IDs at the beginning of this document.

       options: map of string-string pairs

     Common options:

       options: map of string-string pairs
              This column provides general key/value settings.  The  supported
              options are described individually below.

       options : enable_chassis_nb_cfg_update: optional string
              If set to false, ovn-controller will no longer update the nb_cfg
              column  in the Chassis_Private table of the OVN_Southbound data‚Äê
              base. It will still update the  external_ids:ovn-nb-cfg  in  the
              local OVS integration bridge.

     Options for configuring BFD:

       These  options  apply when ovn-controller configures BFD on tunnels in‚Äê
       terfaces.

       options : bfd-min-rx: optional string
              BFD option min-rx value to use when configuring  BFD  on  tunnel
              interfaces.

       options : bfd-decay-min-rx: optional string
              BFD  option  decay-min-rx  value  to use when configuring BFD on
              tunnel interfaces.

       options : bfd-min-tx: optional string
              BFD option min-tx value to use when configuring  BFD  on  tunnel
              interfaces.

       options : bfd-mult: optional string
              BFD  option mult value to use when configuring BFD on tunnel in‚Äê
              terfaces.

       options : debug_drop_domain_id: optional string
              If set to a 8-bit number and if debug_drop_collector_set is also
              configured, ovn-controller will add a  sample  action  to  every
              flow  that  does  not  come  from a logical flow that contains a
              ‚Äôdrop‚Äô action. The 8  most  significant  bits  of  the  observa‚Äê
              tion_domain_id  field  will  be  those  specified  in  the   de‚Ä‚Äê
              bug_drop_domain_id. The 24 least significant bits of the  obser‚Äê
              vation_domain_id field will be zero.

              The  observation_point_id will be set to the OpenFlow table num‚Äê
              ber.

       options : debug_drop_collector_set: optional string
              If set to a 32-bit number ovn-controller will add a  sample  ac‚Äê
              tion  to  every flow that does not come from a logical flow that
              contains a ‚Äôdrop‚Äô action. The sample action will have the speci‚Äê
              fied collector_set_id. The value must match that  of  the  local
              OVS configuration as described in ovs-actions(7).

     Options for configuring ovn-sbctl:

       These options apply when ovn-sbctl connects to OVN Southbound database.

       options : sbctl_probe_interval: optional string
              The  inactivity  probe  interval  of  the  connection to the OVN
              Southbound database from ovn-sbctl utility, in milliseconds.  If
              the value is zero, it disables the connection keepalive feature.

              If the value is nonzero, then it will be forced to a value of at
              least 1000 ms.

              If  the  value  is  less  than zero, then the default inactivity
              probe interval for ovn-sbctl would be left intact (120000 ms).

     Connection Options:

       connections: set of Connections
              Database clients to  which  the  Open  vSwitch  database  server
              should  connect or on which it should listen, along with options
              for how these connections should be configured. See the  Connec‚Ä‚Äê
              tion table for more information.

       ssl: optional SSL
              Global SSL/TLS configuration.

     Security Configurations:

       ipsec: boolean
              Tunnel  encryption  configuration.  If  this column is set to be
              true, all OVN tunnels will be encrypted with IPsec.

Chassis TABLE
       Each row in this table represents a hypervisor or gateway  (a  chassis)
       in  the  physical  network.  Each  chassis, via ovn-controller/ovn-con‚Ä‚Äê
       troller-vtep, adds and updates its own row, and keeps a copy of the re‚Äê
       maining rows to determine how to reach other hypervisors.

       When a chassis shuts down gracefully, it should  remove  its  own  row.
       (This  is  not  critical  because  resources  hosted on the chassis are
       equally unreachable regardless of whether the row  is  present.)  If  a
       chassis  shuts  down permanently without removing its row, some kind of
       manual or automatic cleanup is  eventually  needed;  we  can  devise  a
       process for that as necessary.

       OVN uses encapsulation to transmit logical  dataplane  packets  between
       chassis.

       encaps: set of 1 or more Encaps
              Points  to  supported  encapsulation  configurations to transmit
              logical dataplane packets to this chassis. Each entry is a Encap
              record that describes the configuration.

     Gateway Configuration:

       A gateway is a chassis that forwards traffic  between  the  OVN-managed
       part of a logical network and a physical VLAN, extending a tunnel-based
       logical  network  into a physical network. Gateways are typically dedi‚Äê
       cated nodes that do not host VMs and will  be  controlled  by  ovn-con‚Ä‚Äê
       troller-vtep.

       vtep_logical_switches: set of strings
              Stores  all  VTEP logical switch names connected by this gateway
              chassis. The Port_Binding table entry  with  options:vtep-physi‚Ä‚Äê
              cal-switch  equal  Chassis name, and options:vtep-logical-switch
              value in Chassis vtep_logical_switches, will be associated  with
              this Chassis.

Chassis_Private TABLE
       Each  row in this table maintains per chassis private data that are ac‚Äê
       cessed only by the owning chassis (write only) and ovn-northd,  not  by
       any other chassis. These data are stored in this separate table instead
       of  the  Chassis table for performance considerations: the rows in this
       table can be conditionally monitored by chassises so that each  chassis
       only  get  update  notifications  for its own row, to avoid unnecessary
       chassis private data update flooding in a large scale deployment.

   Summary:
       name                          string (must be unique within table)
       chassis                       optional weak reference to Chassis
       nb_cfg                        integer
       nb_cfg_timestamp              integer
       Common Columns:
         external_ids                map of string-string pairs

   Details:
       name: string (must be unique within table)
              The name of the chassis that owns these chassis-private data.

       chassis: optional weak reference to Chassis
              The reference to Chassis table for the chassis that  owns  these
              chassis-private data.

       nb_cfg: integer
              Sequence  number  for the configuration. When ovn-controller up‚Äê
              dates the configuration of a chassis from the  contents  of  the
              southbound  database,  it copies nb_cfg from the SB_Global table
              into this column.

       nb_cfg_timestamp: integer
              The timestamp when ovn-controller finishes processing the change
              corresponding to nb_cfg.

     Common Columns:

       The overall purpose of these columns is described under Common  Columns
       at the beginning of this document.

       external_ids: map of string-string pairs
Encap TABLE
       The  encaps column in the Chassis table refers to rows in this table to
       identify how OVN may transmit logical dataplane packets to  this  chas‚Äê
       sis.  Each  chassis,  via  ovn-controller(8) or ovn-controller-vtep(8),
       adds and updates its own rows and keeps a copy of the remaining rows to
       determine how to reach other chassis.

   Summary:
       type                          string, either geneve or vxlan
       options                       map of string-string pairs
       options : csum                optional string, either true or false
       options : dst_port            optional string, containing an integer
       options : is_default          optional string, either true or false
       ip                            string
       chassis_name                  string

   Details:
       type: string, either geneve or vxlan
              The encapsulation to use to transmit packets  to  this  chassis.
              Hypervisors and gateways must use geneve or vxlan.

       options: map of string-string pairs
              Options  for  configuring  the  encapsulation, which may be type
              specific.

       options : csum: optional string, either true or false
              csum indicates whether this chassis  can  transmit  and  receive
              packets  that  include checksums with reasonable performance. It
              hints to senders transmitting data to  this  chassis  that  they
              should  use  checksums  to  protect OVN metadata. ovn-controller
              populates this key with the value defined  in  external_ids:ovn-
              encap-csum  column  of  the Open_vSwitch database‚Äôs Open_vSwitch
              table. Other applications should treat this  key  as  read-only.
              See ovn-controller(8) for more information.

              In terms of performance, checksumming actually significantly in‚Äê
              creases  throughput  in  most common cases when running on Linux
              based hosts without NICs supporting encapsulation  hardware  of‚Äê
              fload  (around  60% for bulk traffic). The reason is that gener‚Äê
              ally all NICs are capable of offloading transmitted and received
              TCP/UDP checksums (viewed as ordinary data packets  and  not  as
              tunnels).  The benefit comes on the receive side where the vali‚Äê
              dated outer checksum can be used to additionally validate an in‚Äê
              ner checksum (such as TCP), which in turn allows aggregation  of
              packets to be more efficiently handled by the rest of the stack.

              Not  all  devices see such a benefit. The most notable exception
              is hardware VTEPs. These devices are designed to not buffer  en‚Äê
              tire packets in their switching engines and are therefore unable
              to efficiently compute or validate full packet checksums. In ad‚Äê
              dition  certain  versions  of  the  Linux kernel are not able to
              fully take advantage of encapsulation NIC offloads in the  pres‚Äê
              ence of checksums. (This is actually a pretty narrow corner case
              though:  earlier  versions  of Linux don‚Äôt support encapsulation
              offloads at all and later versions  support  both  offloads  and
              checksums well.)

              csum defaults to false for hardware VTEPs and true for all other
              cases.

              This option applies to geneve and vxlan encapsulations.

       options : dst_port: optional string, containing an integer
              If set, overrides the UDP destination port.

       options : is_default: optional string, either true or false
              When there are multiple encaps for a chassis with different IPs,
              this  option  indicates  if  the  encap  is the default one that
              matches the IP in  external_ids:ovn-encap-ip-default  column  of
              the Open_vSwitch database‚Äôs Open_vSwitch table.

       ip: string
              The IPv4 address of the encapsulation tunnel endpoint.

       chassis_name: string
              The name of the chassis that created this encap.

Address_Set TABLE
       This  table  contains address sets synced from the Address_Set table in
       the  OVN_Northbound  database  and  address  sets  generated  from  the
       Port_Group table in the OVN_Northbound database.

       See the documentation for the Address_Set table and Port_Group table in
       the OVN_Northbound database for details.

   Summary:
       name                          string (must be unique within table)
       addresses                     set of strings

   Details:

       addresses: set of strings
Port_Group TABLE
       This  table  contains  names  for  the  logical  switch  ports  in  the
       OVN_Northbound database that belongs to the same group that is  defined
       in Port_Group in the OVN_Northbound database.

   Summary:

   Details:

       ports: set of strings
Logical_Flow TABLE
       Each  row  in  this table represents one logical flow. ovn-northd popu‚Äê
       lates this table with logical  flows  that  implement  the  L2  and  L3
       topologies  specified  in the OVN_Northbound database. Each hypervisor,
       via ovn-controller, translates the logical flows  into  OpenFlow  flows
       specific to its hypervisor and installs them into Open vSwitch.

       Logical  flows are expressed in an OVN-specific format, described here.
       A logical datapath flow is much like an OpenFlow flow, except that  the
       flows  are  written in terms of logical ports and logical datapaths in‚Äê
       stead of physical ports and  physical  datapaths.  Translation  between
       logical  and  physical  flows helps to ensure isolation between logical
       datapaths. (The logical flow abstraction also allows the  OVN  central‚Äê
       ized  components  to do less work, since they do not have to separately
       compute and push out physical flows to each chassis.)

       The default action when no flow matches is to drop packets.

       Architectural Logical Life Cycle of a Packet

       This following description focuses  on  the  life  cycle  of  a  packet
       through  a logical datapath, ignoring physical details of the implemen‚Äê
       tation. Please refer to Architectural Physical Life Cycle of  a  Packet
       in ovn-architecture(7) for the physical information.

       The  description here is written as if OVN itself executes these steps,
       but in fact OVN (that is, ovn-controller) programs  Open  vSwitch,  via
       OpenFlow and OVSDB, to execute them on its behalf.

       At  a high level, OVN passes each packet through the logical datapath‚Äôs
       logical ingress pipeline, which may output the packet to  one  or  more
       logical  port or logical multicast groups. For each such logical output
       port, OVN passes the  packet  through  the  datapath‚Äôs  logical  egress
       pipeline,  which may either drop the packet or deliver it to the desti‚Äê
       nation. Between the two pipelines, outputs to logical multicast  groups
       are  expanded  into  logical  ports,  so  that the egress pipeline only
       processes a single logical output port  at  a  time.  Between  the  two
       pipelines is also where, when necessary, OVN encapsulates a packet in a
       tunnel (or tunnels) to transmit to remote hypervisors.

       In more detail, to start, OVN searches the Logical_Flow table for a row
       with  correct  logical_datapath  or  a  logical_dp_group, a pipeline of
       ingress, a table_id of 0, and a match that is true for the  packet.  If
       none  is  found,  OVN  drops the packet. If OVN finds more than one, it
       chooses the match with the highest priority. Then OVN executes each  of
       the  actions specified in the row‚Äôs actions column, in the order speci‚Äê
       fied. Some actions, such as those to modify packet headers, require  no
       further details. The next and output actions are special.

       The  next  action  causes the above process to be repeated recursively,
       except that OVN searches for table_id of 1 instead of 0. Similarly, any
       next action in a row found in that table would cause a  further  search
       for  a  table_id  of 2, and so on. When recursive processing completes,
       flow control returns to the action following next.

       The output action also introduces recursion. Its effect depends on  the
       current  value of the outport field. Suppose outport designates a logi‚Äê
       cal port. First, OVN compares inport to outport; if they are equal,  it
       treats the output as a no-op by default. In the common case, where they
       are  different,  the packet enters the egress pipeline. This transition
       to the egress pipeline discards register data, e.g. reg0 ...  reg9  and
       connection  tracking  state,  to achieve uniform behavior regardless of
       whether the egress pipeline is on a different hypervisor (because  reg‚Äê
       isters aren‚Äôt preserve across tunnel encapsulation).

       To execute the egress pipeline, OVN again searches the Logical_Flow ta‚Äê
       ble  for  a  row with correct logical_datapath or a logical_dp_group, a
       table_id of 0, a match that is true for the packet, but now looking for
       a pipeline of egress. If no matching row is found, the output becomes a
       no-op. Otherwise, OVN executes the actions for the matching flow (which
       is chosen from multiple, if necessary, as already described).

       In the egress pipeline, the next action acts as already described,  ex‚Äê
       cept  that it, of course, searches for egress flows. The output action,
       however, now directly outputs the packet to the output port  (which  is
       now fixed, because outport is read-only within the egress pipeline).

       The  description  earlier  assumed  that  outport referred to a logical
       port. If it instead designates a logical multicast group, then the  de‚Äê
       scription  above  still  applies, with the addition of fan-out from the
       logical multicast group to each logical port in  the  group.  For  each
       member  of  the  group, OVN executes the logical pipeline as described,
       with the logical output port replaced by the group member.

       Pipeline Stages

       ovn-northd populates the Logical_Flow table with the logical flows  de‚Äê
       scribed in detail in ovn-northd(8).

   Summary:
       logical_datapath              optional Datapath_Binding
       logical_dp_group              optional Logical_DP_Group
       pipeline                      string, either egress or ingress
       table_id                      integer, in range 0 to 32
       priority                      integer, in range 0 to 65,535
       match                         string
       actions                       string
       tags                          map of string-string pairs
       controller_meter              optional string
       flow_desc                     optional string
       external_ids : stage-name     optional string
       external_ids : stage-hint     optional string, containing an uuid
       external_ids : source         optional string
       Common Columns:
         external_ids                map of string-string pairs

   Details:
       logical_datapath: optional Datapath_Binding
              The logical datapath to which the logical flow belongs.

       logical_dp_group: optional Logical_DP_Group
              The  group  of  logical  datapaths to which the logical flow be‚Äê
              longs. This means that the same  logical  flow  belongs  to  all
              datapaths in a group.

       pipeline: string, either egress or ingress
              The  primary  flows  used for deciding on a packet‚Äôs destination
              are the ingress flows. The egress flows implement ACLs. See Log‚Ä‚Äê
              ical Life Cycle of a Packet, above, for details.

       table_id: integer, in range 0 to 32
              The stage in the logical pipeline, analogous to an OpenFlow  ta‚Äê
              ble number.

       priority: integer, in range 0 to 65,535
              The flow‚Äôs priority. Flows with numerically higher priority take
              precedence  over those with lower. If two logical datapath flows
              with the same priority both match, then the one actually applied
              to the packet is undefined.

       match: string
              A matching expression.  OVN  provides  a  superset  of  OpenFlow
              matching capabilities, using a syntax similar to Boolean expres‚Äê
              sions in a programming language.

              The  most  important  components of match expression are compar‚Äê
              isons  between  symbols   and   constants,   e.g.   ip4.dst   ==
              192.168.0.1,  ip.proto == 6, arp.op == 1, eth.type == 0x800. The
              logical AND operator && and logical OR operator ||  can  combine
              comparisons into a larger expression.

              Matching  expressions also support parentheses for grouping, the
              logical NOT prefix operator !, and literals 0 and 1  to  express
              ``false‚Äô‚Äô or ``true,‚Äô‚Äô respectively. The latter is useful by it‚Äê
              self as a catch-all expression that matches every packet.

              Match  expressions  also  support a kind of function syntax. The
              following functions are supported:

              is_chassis_resident(lport)
                     Evaluates to true on a  chassis  on  which  logical  port
                     lport  (a quoted string) resides, and to false elsewhere.
                     This function was introduced in OVN 2.7.

              Symbols

              Type. Symbols have integer or string type. Integer symbols  have
              a width in bits.

              Kinds. There are three kinds of symbols:

              ‚Ä¢      Fields.  A  field  symbol  represents  a packet header or
                     metadata field. For example, a field named vlan.tci might
                     represent the VLAN TCI field in a packet.

                     A field symbol can have integer or string  type.  Integer
                     fields  can  be nominal or ordinal (see Level of Measure‚Ä‚Äê
                     ment, below).

              ‚Ä¢      Subfields. A subfield represents a subset of bits from  a
                     larger  field. For example, a field vlan.vid might be de‚Äê
                     fined as an alias for vlan.tci[0..11]. Subfields are pro‚Äê
                     vided for syntactic convenience,  because  it  is  always
                     possible  to  instead  refer  to  a subset of bits from a
                     field directly.

                     Only ordinal fields (see Level of Measurement, below) may
                     have subfields. Subfields are always ordinal.

              ‚Ä¢      Predicates. A predicate is shorthand for  a  Boolean  ex‚Äê
                     pression.  Predicates may be used much like 1-bit fields.
                     For example, ip4 might expand to eth.type == 0x800. Pred‚Äê
                     icates are provided for syntactic convenience, because it
                     is always possible to instead specify the underlying  ex‚Äê
                     pression directly.

                     A  predicate  whose expansion refers to any nominal field
                     or predicate (see Level of Measurement, below)  is  nomi‚Äê
                     nal; other predicates have Boolean level of measurement.

              Level              of              Measurement.              See
              http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement for  the  sta‚Äê
              tistical  concept  on  which this classification is based. There
              are three levels:

              ‚Ä¢      Ordinal. In statistics, ordinal values can be ordered  on
                     a  scale. OVN considers a field (or subfield) to be ordi‚Äê
                     nal if its bits can be  examined  individually.  This  is
                     true  for  the  OpenFlow  fields  that  OpenFlow  or Open
                     vSwitch makes ``maskable.‚Äô‚Äô

                     Any use of a ordinal field may specify a single bit or  a
                     range  of  bits,  e.g. vlan.tci[13..15] refers to the PCP
                     field within the VLAN TCI, and eth.dst[40] refers to  the
                     multicast bit in the Ethernet destination address.

                     OVN  supports all the usual arithmetic relations (==, !=,
                     <, <=, >, and >=) on ordinal fields and their  subfields,
                     because  OVN  can  implement  these  in OpenFlow and Open
                     vSwitch as collections of bitwise tests.

              ‚Ä¢      Nominal. In statistics, nominal values cannot be usefully
                     compared except for equality. This is  true  of  OpenFlow
                     port  numbers, Ethernet types, and IP protocols are exam‚Äê
                     ples: all of these are just  identifiers  assigned  arbi‚Äê
                     trarily  with  no  deeper  meaning.  In OpenFlow and Open
                     vSwitch, bits in these fields generally aren‚Äôt  individu‚Äê
                     ally addressable.

                     OVN  only supports arithmetic tests for equality on nomi‚Äê
                     nal fields, because OpenFlow and Open vSwitch provide  no
                     way for a flow to efficiently implement other comparisons
                     on  them. (A test for inequality can be sort of built out
                     of two flows with different priorities, but OVN  matching
                     expressions  always  generate  flows with a single prior‚Äê
                     ity.)

                     String fields are always nominal.

              ‚Ä¢      Boolean. A nominal field that has only two values, 0  and
                     1,  is  somewhat exceptional, since it is easy to support
                     both equality and inequality tests on such a  field:  ei‚Äê
                     ther one can be implemented as a test for 0 or 1.

                     Only  predicates (see above) have a Boolean level of mea‚Äê
                     surement.

                     This isn‚Äôt a standard level of measurement.

              Prerequisites. Any symbol can have prerequisites, which are  ad‚Äê
              ditional  condition  implied by the use of the symbol. For exam‚Äê
              ple, For example,  icmp4.type  symbol  might  have  prerequisite
              icmp4, which would cause an expression icmp4.type == 0 to be in‚Äê
              terpreted  as  icmp4.type == 0 && icmp4, which would in turn ex‚Äê
              pand to icmp4.type == 0 && eth.type == 0x800 && ip4.proto  ==  1
              (assuming  icmp4 is a predicate defined as suggested under Types
              above).

              Relational operators

              All of the standard relational operators ==, !=, <, <=,  >,  and
              >=  are  supported.  Nominal  fields support only == and !=, and
              only in a positive sense when outer ! are  taken  into  account,
              e.g. given string field inport, inport == "eth0" and !(inport !=
              "eth0") are acceptable, but not inport != "eth0".

              The implementation of == (or != when it is negated), is more ef‚Äê
              ficient than that of the other relational operators.

              Constants

              Integer  constants may be expressed in decimal, hexadecimal pre‚Äê
              fixed by 0x, or as dotted-quad IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses in
              their standard forms, or Ethernet addresses  as  colon-separated
              hex  digits. A constant in any of these forms may be followed by
              a slash and a second constant (the mask) in the  same  form,  to
              form  a masked constant. IPv4 and IPv6 masks may be given as in‚Äê
              tegers, to express CIDR prefixes.

              String constants have the same syntax as quoted strings in  JSON
              (thus, they are Unicode strings).

              Some  operators  support  sets of constants written inside curly
              braces { ... }. Commas between elements of a set, and after  the
              last  elements,  are  optional. With ==, ``field == { constant1,
              constant2, ... }‚Äô‚Äô is syntactic sugar for ``field  ==  constant1
              || field == constant2 || .... Similarly, ``field != { constant1,
              constant2,  ...  }‚Äô‚Äô  is  equivalent  to ``field != constant1 &&
              field != constant2 && ...‚Äô‚Äô.

              You may refer to a set of IPv4, IPv6, or MAC addresses stored in
              the Address_Set table by its name. An Address_Set with a name of
              set1 can be referred to as $set1.

              You may refer to a group of logical switch ports stored  in  the
              Port_Group  table  by  its  name.  An  Port_Group with a name of
              port_group1 can be referred to as @port_group1.

              Additionally, you may refer to the set of addresses belonging to
              a group of logical switch ports stored in the  Port_Group  table
              by its name followed by a suffix ‚Äô_ip4‚Äô/‚Äô_ip6‚Äô. The IPv4 address
              set  of  a Port_Group with a name of port_group1 can be referred
              to as $port_group1_ip4, and the IPv6 address  set  of  the  same
              Port_Group can be referred to as $port_group1_ip6

              Miscellaneous

              Comparisons  may  name  the  symbol  or the constant first, e.g.
              tcp.src == 80 and 80 == tcp.src are both acceptable.

              Tests for a range may be expressed using a syntax like  1024  <=
              tcp.src  <=  49151,  which  is  equivalent to 1024 <= tcp.src &&
              tcp.src <= 49151.

              For a one-bit field or predicate,  a  mention  of  its  name  is
              equivalent  to  symobl  == 1, e.g. vlan.present is equivalent to
              vlan.present == 1. The same is true for one-bit subfields,  e.g.
              vlan.tci[12].  There  is no technical limitation to implementing
              the same for ordinal fields of all widths, but  the  implementa‚Äê
              tion is expensive enough that the syntax parser requires writing
              an  explicit  comparison  against  zero  to  make  mistakes less
              likely, e.g. in tcp.src != 0 the comparison  against  0  is  re‚Äê
              quired.

              Operator  precedence  is as shown below, from highest to lowest.
              There are two exceptions where  parentheses  are  required  even
              though  the table would suggest that they are not: && and || re‚Äê
              quire parentheses when used together, and ! requires parentheses
              when applied to a relational expression. Thus, in  (eth.type  ==
              0x800 || eth.type == 0x86dd) && ip.proto == 6 or !(arp.op == 1),
              the parentheses are mandatory.

              Comments may be introduced by //, which extends to the next new-
              line. Comments within a line may be bracketed by /* and */. Mul‚Äê
              tiline comments are not supported.

              Symbols

              Most  of  the  symbols  below have integer type. Only inport and
              outport have string type. inport names a logical port. Thus, its
              value is a logical_port name from the Port_Binding  table.  out‚Ä‚Äê
              port  may name a logical port, as inport, or a logical multicast
              group defined in the Multicast_Group table.  For  both  symbols,
              only names within the flow‚Äôs logical datapath may be used.

              The  regX  symbols  are  32-bit integers. The xxregX symbols are
              128-bit integers, which overlay four of  the  32-bit  registers:
              xxreg0 overlays reg0 through reg3, with reg0 supplying the most-
              significant  bits  of  xxreg0  and  reg3  the least-significant.
              xxreg1 similarly overlays reg4 through reg7.

                     ‚Ä¢      ct.trk:  Always set to true by ct_next to indicate
                            that connection  tracking  has  taken  place.  All
                            other ct subfields have ct.trk as a prerequisite.

                     The  ct_dnat,  ct_snat,  and ct_lb actions initialize the

       actions: string
              Logical datapath actions, to be executed when the  logical  flow
              represented by this row is the highest-priority match.

              Actions share lexical syntax with the match column. An empty set
              of  actions (or one that contains just white space or comments),
              or a set of actions that consists  of  just  drop;,  causes  the
              matched packets to be dropped. Otherwise, the column should con‚Äê
              tain a sequence of actions, each terminated by a semicolon.

              The following actions are defined:

              output;
                     In  the ingress pipeline, this action executes the egress
                     pipeline as a subroutine.  If  outport  names  a  logical
                     port,  the egress pipeline executes once; if it is a mul‚Äê
                     ticast group, the egress pipeline runs once for each log‚Äê
                     ical port in the group.

                     In the egress pipeline, this action performs  the  actual
                     output  to  the  outport  logical  port.  (In  the egress
                     pipeline, outport never names a multicast group.)

                     By default,  output  to  the  input  port  is  implicitly
                     dropped,  that  is,  output becomes a no-op if outport ==
                     inport. Occasionally it may be useful  to  override  this
                     behavior, e.g. to send an ARP reply to an ARP request; to
                     do  so,  use  flags.loopback  =  1 to allow the packet to
                     "hair-pin" back to the input port.

              next;
              next(table);
              next(pipeline=pipeline, table=table);
                   Executes the given logical datapath table in pipeline as  a
                   subroutine.  The  default  table  is just after the current
                   one. If pipeline is specified, it may be ingress or egress;
                   the default pipeline is the one  currently  executing.  Ac‚Äê
                   tions  in the both ingress and egress pipeline can use next
                   to jump across the other pipeline. Actions in  the  ingress
                   pipeline should use next to jump into the specific table of
                   egress  pipeline only if it is certain that the packets are
                   local and not tunnelled and wants to skip certain stages in
                   the packet processing.

              field = constant;
                   Sets data or metadata field field to  constant  value  con‚Äê
                   stant,  e.g.  outport  =  "vif0"; to set the logical output
                   port. To set only a subset of bits in a  field,  specify  a
                   subfield  for  field or a masked constant, e.g. one may use
                   vlan.pcp[2] = 1; or vlan.pcp = 4/4; to set the most signif‚Äê
                   icant bit of the VLAN PCP.

                   Assigning to a field  with  prerequisites  implicitly  adds
                   those  prerequisites  to  match;  thus, for example, a flow
                   that sets tcp.dst applies only to TCP flows, regardless  of
                   whether its match mentions any TCP field.

                   Not  all  fields are modifiable (e.g. eth.type and ip.proto
                   are read-only), and not all modifiable fields may  be  par‚Äê
                   tially modified (e.g. ip.ttl must assigned as a whole). The
                   outport field is modifiable in the ingress pipeline but not
                   in the egress pipeline.

              ovn_field = constant;
                   Sets OVN field ovn_field to constant value constant.

                   OVN supports setting the values of certain fields which are
                   not yet supported in OpenFlow to set or modify them.

                   Below are the supported OVN fields:

                   ‚Ä¢      icmp4.frag_mtu icmp6.frag_mtu

                          This  field  sets  the  low-order  16  bits  of  the
                          ICMP{4,6} header field that is labelled "unused"  in
                          the  ICMP  specification  as defined in the RFC 1191
                          with the value specified in constant.

                          Eg. icmp4.frag_mtu = 1500;

              field1 = field2;
                   Sets data or metadata field field1 to the value of data  or
                   metadata  field field2, e.g. reg0 = ip4.src; copies ip4.src
                   into reg0. To modify only a subset of a field‚Äôs bits, spec‚Äê
                   ify a subfield for field1 or field2 or both, e.g.  vlan.pcp
                   =  reg0[0..2];  copies  the  least-significant bits of reg0
                   into the VLAN PCP.

                   field1 and field2 must be the same type, either both string
                   or both integer fields. If they are  both  integer  fields,
                   they must have the same width.

                   If  field1  or field2 has prerequisites, they are added im‚Äê
                   plicitly to match. It is possible to  write  an  assignment
                   with   contradictory   prerequisites,  such  as  ip4.src  =
                   ip6.src[0..31];, but the contradiction means that a logical
                   flow with such an assignment will never be matched.

              field1 <-> field2;
                   Similar to field1 = field2; except that the two values  are
                   exchanged  instead  of  copied. Both field1 and field2 must
                   modifiable.

              push(field);
                   Push the value of field to the stack top.

              pop(field);
                   Pop the stack top and store the value to field, which  must
                   be modifiable.

              ip.ttl--;
                   Decrements the IPv4 or IPv6 TTL. If this would make the TTL
                   zero  or  negative, then processing of the packet halts; no
                   further actions are processed.  (To  properly  handle  such
                   cases, a higher-priority flow should match on ip.ttl == {0,
                   1};.)

              ct_next;
              ct_next(dnat);
              ct_next(snat);
                   Apply   connection   tracking  to  the  flow,  initializing
                   ct_state for matching in later tables. Automatically  moves
                   on to the next table, as if followed by next.

                   As  a  side  effect,  IP  fragments will be reassembled for
                   matching. If a fragmented packet is output, then it will be
                   sent with any overlapping fragments squashed.  The  connec‚Äê
                   tion  tracking state is scoped by the logical port when the
                   action is used in a flow for a logical switch, so  overlap‚Äê
                   ping addresses may be used. To allow traffic related to the
                   matched flow, execute ct_commit . Connection tracking state
                   is  scoped  by the logical topology when the action is used
                   in a flow for a router.

                   It is possible to have actions  follow  ct_next,  but  they
                   will  not have access to any of its side-effects and is not
                   generally useful.

              ct_commit { };
              ct_commit { ct_mark=value[/mask]; };
              ct_commit { ct_label=value[/mask]; };
              ct_commit { ct_mark=value[/mask]; ct_label=value[/mask]; };
                   Commit the flow to the connection tracking entry associated
                   with   it   by   a   previous   call   to   ct_next.   When
                   ct_mark=value[/mask]  and/or ct_label=value[/mask] are sup‚Äê
                   plied, ct_mark and/or ct_label will be set  to  the  values
                   indicated by value[/mask] on the connection tracking entry.
                   ct_mark is a 32-bit field. ct_label is a 128-bit field. The
                   value[/mask] should be specified in hex string if more than
                   64bits are to be used. Registers and other named fields can
                   be  used  for  value.  ct_mark  and ct_label may be sub-ad‚Äê
                   dressed in order to have specific bits set.

                   Note that if you want processing to continue  in  the  next
                   table,  you  must  execute the next action after ct_commit.
                   You may also leave out next which  will  commit  connection
                   tracking  state,  and  then  drop the packet. This could be
                   useful for setting ct_mark on a connection  tracking  entry
                   before dropping a packet, for example.

              ct_commit_to_zone(dnat);
              ct_commit_to_zone(snat);
                   Commit  the  flow  to  the  specific zone in the connection
                   tracker. The packet is then automatically sent to the  next
                   tables as if followed by next; action. The next tables will
                   see  the  changes  in  the  packet caused by the connection
                   tracker.

                   Note that this action is meaningful  only  in  the  Logical
                   Router Datapath as the Logical Switch Datapath does not use
                   separate  connection  tracking  zones. Using this action in
                   Logical Switch Datapath falls back to committing  the  flow
                   into the logical port‚Äôs conntrack zone.

              ct_dnat;
              ct_dnat(IP);
                   ct_dnat  sends  the packet through the DNAT zone in connec‚Äê
                   tion tracking table to unDNAT any packet that was DNATed in
                   the opposite direction. The packet  is  then  automatically
                   sent to the next tables as if followed by next; action. The
                   next  tables  will  see the changes in the packet caused by
                   the connection tracker.

                   ct_dnat(IP) sends the  packet  through  the  DNAT  zone  to
                   change  the destination IP address of the packet to the one
                   provided inside the parentheses and commits the connection.
                   The packet is then automatically sent to the next tables as

                   ct_snat  sends  the  packet through the SNAT zone to unSNAT
                   any packet that was SNATed in the opposite  direction.  The
                   packet  is automatically sent to the next tables as if fol‚Äê

                   ct_snat(IP)  sends  the  packet  through  the  SNAT zone to
                   change the source IP address of the packet to the one  pro‚Äê
                   vided  inside  the  parenthesis and commits the connection.
                   The packet is then automatically sent to the next tables as

              ct_dnat_in_czone;
              ct_dnat_in_czone(IP);
                   ct_dnat_in_czone  sends  the  packet through the common NAT
                   zone (used for both DNAT and SNAT) in  connection  tracking
                   table  to unDNAT any packet that was DNATed in the opposite
                   direction. The packet is then  automatically  sent  to  the
                   next tables as if followed by next; action. The next tables
                   will see the changes in the packet caused by the connection
                   tracker.

                   ct_dnat_in_czone(IP)  sends  the  packet through the common
                   NAT zone to change the destination IP address of the packet
                   to the one provided inside the parentheses and commits  the
                   connection.  The  packet  is then automatically sent to the
                   next tables as if followed by next; action. The next tables
                   will see the changes in the packet caused by the connection

              ct_snat_in_czone;
              ct_snat_in_czone(IP);
                   ct_snat_in_czone sends the packet through  the  common  NAT
                   zone  to  unSNAT any packet that was SNATed in the opposite
                   direction. The packet is automatically sent to the next ta‚Äê
                   bles as if followed by the next; action.  The  next  tables
                   will see the changes in the packet caused by the connection
                   tracker.

                   ct_snat_in_czone(IP)  sends  the packet\ through the common
                   NAT zone to change the source IP address of the  packet  to
                   the  one  provided  inside  the parenthesis and commits the
                   connection. The packet is then automatically  sent  to  the
                   next tables as if followed by next; action. The next tables
                   will see the changes in the packet caused by the connection

              ct_clear;
                   Clears connection tracking state.

              ct_commit_nat;
                   Applies NAT and commits the connection to the CT. Automati‚Äê
                   cally  moves  on to the next table, as if followed by next.
                   This is very useful for connections  that  are  in  related
                   state  for  already existing connections and allows the NAT
                   to be applied to them as well.

              clone { action; ... };
                   Makes a copy of the packet  being  processed  and  executes
                   each  action  on  the copy. Actions following the clone ac‚Äê
                   tion, if any, apply to  the  original,  unmodified  packet.
                   This  can  be  used  as  a  way to ``save and restore‚Äô‚Äô the
                   packet around a set of  actions  that  may  modify  it  and
                   should not persist.

              arp { action; ... };
                   Temporarily  replaces the IPv4 packet being processed by an
                   ARP packet and executes  each  nested  action  on  the  ARP
                   packet.  Actions following the arp action, if any, apply to
                   the original, unmodified packet.

                   The ARP packet that this action operates on is  initialized
                   based on the IPv4 packet being processed, as follows. These
                   are  default  values  that the nested actions will probably
                   want to change:

                   ‚Ä¢      eth.src unchanged

                   ‚Ä¢      eth.dst unchanged

                   ‚Ä¢      eth.type = 0x0806

                   ‚Ä¢      arp.op = 1 (ARP request)

                   ‚Ä¢      arp.sha copied from eth.src

                   ‚Ä¢      arp.tpa copied from ip4.dst

                   The ARP packet has the same VLAN header, if any, as the  IP
                   packet it replaces.

              get_arp(P, A);
                   Parameters:  logical port string field P, 32-bit IP address
                   field A.

                   Looks up A in P‚Äôs mac binding table. If an entry is  found,

                   Parameters: logical port string field P, 32-bit IP  address
                   field A, 48-bit Ethernet address field E.

                   Adds  or updates the entry for IP address A in logical port
                   P‚Äôs mac binding table, setting its Ethernet address to E.

                   Example: put_arp(inport, arp.spa, arp.sha);

                   Parameters: logical port string field P, 32-bit IP  address
                   field A, 48-bit MAC address field M.

                   Result: stored to a 1-bit subfield R.

                   Looks  up  A and M in P‚Äôs mac binding table. If an entry is
                   found, stores 1 in the 1-bit subfield R, else 0.

                   Example: reg0[0] = lookup_arp(inport, arp.spa, arp.sha);

              R = lookup_arp_ip(P, A);
                   Parameters: logical port string field P, 32-bit IP  address
                   field A.

                   Result: stored to a 1-bit subfield R.

                   Looks  up A in P‚Äôs mac binding table. If an entry is found,
                   stores 1 in the 1-bit subfield R, else 0.

              P = get_fdb(A);
                   Parameters:48-bit MAC address field A.

                   Looks up A in fdb table. If an entry is found,  stores  the
                   logical port key to the out parameter P.

                   Example: outport = get_fdb(eth.src);

              put_fdb(P, A);
                   Parameters: logical port string field P, 48-bit MAC address
                   field A.

                   Adds or updates the entry for Ethernet address A in fdb ta‚Äê
                   ble, setting its logical port key to P.

                   Example: put_fdb(inport, arp.spa);

              R = lookup_fdb(P, A);
                   Parameters: 48-bit MAC address field M, logical port string
                   field P.

                   Result: stored to a 1-bit subfield R.

                   Looks up A in fdb table. If an entry is found and the logi‚Äê
                   cal  port  key  is  P, P, stores 1 in the 1-bit subfield R,
                   else 0. If flags.localnet is set then 1 is stored if an en‚Äê
                   try is found and the logical port key is P or if  an  entry
                   is found and the entry port type is VIF.

                   ‚Ä¢      eth.dst exchanged with eth.src

                   ‚Ä¢      eth.type = 0x86dd

                   ‚Ä¢      ip6.dst copied from ip6.src

                   ‚Ä¢      ip6.src copied from nd.target

                   ‚Ä¢      icmp6.type = 136 (Neighbor Advertisement)

                   ‚Ä¢      nd.tll copied from eth.dst

                   The ND packet has the same VLAN header, if any, as the IPv6
                   packet it replaces.

                   Prerequisite: nd_ns

              nd_na_router { action; ... };
                   Temporarily  replaces the IPv6 neighbor solicitation packet
                   being processed by  an  IPv6  neighbor  advertisement  (NA)
                   packet,  sets  ND_NSO_ROUTER  in the RSO flags and executes
                   each nested action on the NA packet. Actions following  the
                   nd_na_router action, if any, apply to the original, unmodi‚Äê
                   fied packet.

                   The  NA  packet that this action operates on is initialized
                   based on the IPv6 packet being processed, as follows. These
                   are default values that the nested  actions  will  probably
                   want to change:

                   ‚Ä¢      eth.dst exchanged with eth.src

                   ‚Ä¢      eth.type = 0x86dd

                   ‚Ä¢      ip6.dst copied from ip6.src

                   ‚Ä¢      ip6.src copied from nd.target

                   ‚Ä¢      icmp6.type = 136 (Neighbor Advertisement)

                   ‚Ä¢      nd.target unchanged

                   ‚Ä¢      nd.tll copied from eth.dst

                   The ND packet has the same VLAN header, if any, as the IPv6
                   packet it replaces.

                   Prerequisite: nd_ns

              get_nd(P, A);
                   Parameters:  logical  port string field P, 128-bit IPv6 ad‚Äê
                   dress field A.

                   Looks up A in P‚Äôs mac binding table. If an entry is  found,
                   stores  its  Ethernet  address in eth.dst, otherwise stores
                   00:00:00:00:00:00 in eth.dst.

                   Example: get_nd(outport, ip6.dst);

              put_nd(P, A, E);
                   Parameters: logical port string field P, 128-bit  IPv6  ad‚Äê
                   dress field A, 48-bit Ethernet address field E.

                   Adds  or  updates  the  entry for IPv6 address A in logical
                   port P‚Äôs mac binding table, setting its Ethernet address to
                   E.

                   Example: put_nd(inport, nd.target, nd.tll);

              R = lookup_nd(P, A, M);
                   Parameters: logical port string field P, 128-bit IP address
                   field A, 48-bit MAC address field M.

                   Result: stored to a 1-bit subfield R.

                   Looks up A and M in P‚Äôs mac binding table. If an  entry  is
                   found, stores 1 in the 1-bit subfield R, else 0.

                   Example: reg0[0] = lookup_nd(inport, ip6.src, eth.src);

              R = lookup_nd_ip(P, A);
                   Parameters: logical port string field P, 128-bit IP address
                   field A.

                   Result: stored to a 1-bit subfield R.

                   Looks  up A in P‚Äôs mac binding table. If an entry is found,
                   stores 1 in the 1-bit subfield R, else 0.

                   Example: reg0[0] = lookup_nd_ip(inport, ip6.src);

              R = put_dhcp_opts(D1 = V1, D2 = V2, ..., Dn = Vn);
                   Parameters: one or more DHCP option/value pairs, which must
                   include an offerip option (with code 0).

                   Result: stored to a 1-bit subfield R.

                   Valid only in the ingress pipeline.

                   When this action  is  applied  to  a  DHCP  request  packet
                   (DHCPDISCOVER or DHCPREQUEST), it changes the packet into a
                   DHCP  reply  (DHCPOFFER or DHCPACK, respectively), replaces
                   the options by those specified as parameters, and stores  1
                   in R.

                   When  this action is applied to a non-DHCP packet or a DHCP
                   packet that is not DHCPDISCOVER or DHCPREQUEST,  it  leaves
                   the packet unchanged and stores 0 in R.

                   The  contents of the DHCP_Option table control the DHCP op‚Äê
                   tion names and values that this action supports.

                   Example: reg0[0] = put_dhcp_opts(offerip = 10.0.0.2, router
                   = 10.0.0.1, netmask = 255.255.255.0, dns_server = {8.8.8.8,
                   7.7.7.7});

              R = put_dhcpv6_opts(D1 = V1, D2 = V2, ..., Dn = Vn);
                   Parameters: one or more DHCPv6 option/value pairs.

                   Result: stored to a 1-bit subfield R.

                   Valid only in the ingress pipeline.

                   When this action is applied to a DHCPv6 request packet,  it
                   changes  the  packet  into a DHCPv6 reply, replaces the op‚Äê
                   tions by those specified as parameters, and stores 1 in R.

                   When this action is applied to a non-DHCPv6  packet  or  an
                   invalid  DHCPv6  request  packet , it leaves the packet un‚Äê
                   changed and stores 0 in R.

                   The contents of the DHCPv6_Options table control the DHCPv6
                   option names and values that this action supports.

                   Example:  reg0[3]  =  put_dhcpv6_opts(ia_addr  =   aef0::4,
                   server_id                =               00:00:00:00:10:02,
                   dns_server={ae70::1,ae70::2});

              set_queue(queue_number);
                   Parameters: Queue number queue_number, in the  range  0  to
                   61440.

                   This  is a logical equivalent of the OpenFlow set_queue ac‚Äê
                   tion. It affects packets that egress a hypervisor through a
                   physical interface. For nonzero queue_number, it configures
                   packet queuing to match the  settings  configured  for  the
                   Port_Binding     with    options:qdisc_queue_id    matching
                   queue_number. When queue_number is zero, it resets  queuing
                   to the default strategy.

                   Example: set_queue(10);

              ct_lb;
              ct_lb(backends=ip[:port][,...][;
              hash_fields=field1,field2,...][; ct_flag]);
                   With  arguments, ct_lb commits the packet to the connection
                   tracking table and DNATs the packet‚Äôs  destination  IP  ad‚Äê
                   dress  (and  port)  to the IP address or addresses (and op‚Äê
                   tional ports) specified in the backends. If multiple comma-
                   separated IP addresses are specified, each is  given  equal
                   weight for picking the DNAT address. By default, dp_hash is
                   used  as  the  OpenFlow  group  selection  method,  but  if
                   hash_fields is specified, hash is  used  as  the  selection
                   method,  and the fields listed are used as the hash fields.
                   The  ct_flag  field  represents  one  of  supported   flag:
                   skip_snat or force_snat, this flag will be stored in ct_la‚Ä‚Äê
                   bel register.

                   Without arguments, ct_lb sends the packet to the connection
                   tracking table to NAT the packets. If the packet is part of
                   an  established connection that was previously committed to
                   the connection tracker via ct_lb(...),  it  will  automati‚Äê
                   cally get DNATed to the same IP address as the first packet
                   in that connection.

                   Processing  automatically moves on to the next table, as if
                   next; were specified, and later tables act on the packet as
                   modified by the  connection  tracker.  Connection  tracking
                   state is scoped by the logical port when the action is used
                   in  a  flow  for a logical switch, so overlapping addresses
                   may be used. Connection tracking state  is  scoped  by  the
                   logical  topology  when  the action is used in a flow for a
                   router.

              ct_lb_mark;
              ct_lb_mark(backends=ip[:port][,...][;
              hash_fields=field1,field2,...][; ct_flag]);
                   Same as ct_lb, except that it internally  uses  ct_mark  to
                   store  the NAT flag, while ct_lb uses ct_label for the same
                   purpose.

              R = dns_lookup();
                   Parameters: No parameters.

                   Result: stored to a 1-bit subfield R.

                   Valid only in the ingress pipeline.

                   When this action is applied to a valid DNS request  (a  UDP
                   packet  typically  directed to port 53), it attempts to re‚Äê
                   solve the query using the contents of the DNS table. If  it
                   is  successful,  it changes the packet into a DNS reply and
                   stores 1 in R. If  the  action  is  applied  to  a  non-DNS
                   packet,  an  invalid DNS request packet, or a valid DNS re‚Äê
                   quest for which the DNS table does not supply an answer, it
                   leaves the packet unchanged and stores 0 in R.

                   Regardless of success, the action does not make any of  the
                   changes to the flow that are necessary to direct the packet
                   back  to  the requester. The logical pipeline can implement
                   this behavior with matches and actions in later tables.

                   Example: reg0[3] = dns_lookup();

                   Prerequisite: udp

              R = put_nd_ra_opts(D1 = V1, D2 = V2, ..., Dn = Vn);
                   Parameters: The following IPv6 ND Router Advertisement  op‚Äê
                   tion/value pairs as defined in RFC 4861.

                   ‚Ä¢      addr_mode

                          Mandatory parameter which specifies the address mode
                          flag  to  be  set  in the RA flag options field. The
                          value of this option is a string and  the  following
                          values  can  be defined - "slaac", "dhcpv6_stateful"
                          and "dhcpv6_stateless".

                   ‚Ä¢      slla

                          Mandatory parameter which specifies  the  link-layer
                          address  of  the interface from which the Router Ad‚Äê
                          vertisement is sent.

                   ‚Ä¢      mtu

                          Optional parameter which specifies the MTU.

                   ‚Ä¢      prefix

                          Optional parameter which should be specified if  the
                          addr_mode  is  "slaac"  or  "dhcpv6_stateless".  The
                          value should be an IPv6 prefix which  will  be  used
                          for  stateless  IPv6 address configuration. This op‚Äê
                          tion can be defined multiple times.

                   Result: stored to a 1-bit subfield R.

                   Valid only in the ingress pipeline.

                   When this action is applied to an IPv6 Router  solicitation
                   request  packet,  it changes the packet into an IPv6 Router
                   Advertisement reply and adds the options specified  in  the
                   parameters, and stores 1 in R.

                   When  this action is applied to a non-IPv6 Router solicita‚Äê
                   tion packet or an invalid IPv6 request packet ,  it  leaves
                   the packet unchanged and stores 0 in R.

                   Example: reg0[3] = put_nd_ra_opts(addr_mode = "slaac", slla
                   = 00:00:00:00:10:02, prefix = aef0::/64, mtu = 1450);

              set_meter(rate);
              set_meter(rate, burst);
                   Parameters:  rate  limit int field rate in kbps, burst rate
                   limits int field burst in kbps.

                   This action sets the rate limit for a flow.

                   Example: set_meter(100, 1000);

              R = check_pkt_larger(L)
                   Parameters: packet length L to check for in bytes.

                   Result: stored to a 1-bit subfield R.

                   This   is   a   logical   equivalent   of   the    OpenFlow
                   check_pkt_larger  action.  If the packet is larger than the
                   length specified in L, it stores 1 in the subfield R.

                   Example: reg0[6] = check_pkt_larger(1000);

              log(key=value, ...);
                     Causes ovn-controller to log the packet  on  the  chassis
                     that processes it. Packet logging currently uses the same
                     logging mechanism as other Open vSwitch and OVN messages,
                     which  means  that  whether and where log messages appear
                     depends on the local logging configuration  that  can  be
                     configured with ovn-appctl, etc.

                     The  log  action takes zero or more of the following key-
                     value pair arguments that control what is logged:

                     name=string
                            An optional name for the ACL. The string  is  cur‚Äê
                            rently limited to 64 bytes.

                     severity=level
                            Indicates  the severity of the event. The level is
                            one of following  (from  more  to  less  serious):
                            alert,  warning,  notice,  info,  or  debug.  If a
                            severity is not provided, the default is info.

                     verdict=value
                            The verdict for packets  matching  the  flow.  The
                            value must be one of allow, deny, or reject.

                     meter=string
                            An  optional  rate-limiting meter to be applied to
                            the logs. The string should reference a name entry
                            from the Meter table. The only meter  action  that
                            is appropriate is drop.

              fwd_group(liveness=bool, childports=port, ...);
                     Parameters:  optional liveness, either true or false, de‚Äê
                     faulting to false; childports, a comma-delimited list  of
                     strings denoting logical ports to load balance across.

                     Load balance traffic to one or more child ports in a log‚Äê
                     ical switch. ovn-controller translates the fwd_group into
                     an OpenFlow group with one bucket for each child port. If
                     liveness=true is specified, it also integrates the bucket
                     selection  with BFD status on the tunnel interface corre‚Äê
                     sponding to child port.

              icmp4 { action; ... };
              icmp4_error { action; ... };
                   Temporarily replaces the IPv4 packet being processed by  an
                   ICMPv4 packet and executes each nested action on the ICMPv4
                   packet.  Actions  following these actions, if any, apply to
                   the original, unmodified packet.

                   The ICMPv4 packet that these actions operates  on  is  ini‚Äê
                   tialized  based on the IPv4 packet being processed, as fol‚Äê
                   lows. These are default values that the nested actions will
                   probably want to  change.  Ethernet  and  IPv4  fields  not
                   listed here are not changed:

                   ‚Ä¢      ip.proto = 1 (ICMPv4)

                   ‚Ä¢      ip.frag = 0 (not a fragment)

                   ‚Ä¢      ip.ttl = 255

                   ‚Ä¢      icmp4.type = 3 (destination unreachable)

                   ‚Ä¢      icmp4.code = 1 (host unreachable)

                   icmp4_error  action  is  expected to be used to generate an
                   ICMPv4 packet in  response  to  an  error  in  original  IP
                   packet.  When  this  action generates the ICMPv4 packet, it
                   also copies the original IP datagram following  the  ICMPv4
                   header as per RFC 1122: 3.2.2.

                   Prerequisite: ip4

              icmp6 { action; ... };
              icmp6_error { action; ... };
                   Temporarily  replaces the IPv6 packet being processed by an
                   ICMPv6 packet and executes each nested action on the ICMPv6
                   packet. Actions following the icmp6 action, if  any,  apply
                   to the original, unmodified packet.

                   The  ICMPv6 packet that this action operates on is initial‚Äê
                   ized based on the IPv6 packet being processed, as  follows.
                   These are default values that the nested actions will prob‚Äê
                   ably  want  to  change. Ethernet and IPv6 fields not listed
                   here are not changed:

                   ‚Ä¢      ip.proto = 58 (ICMPv6)

                   ‚Ä¢      ip.ttl = 255

                   ‚Ä¢      icmp6.type = 1 (destination unreachable)

                   ‚Ä¢      icmp6.code = 1 (administratively prohibited)

                   icmp6_error action is expected to be used  to  generate  an
                   ICMPv6  packet  in  response  to  an error in original IPv6
                   packet.

              tcp_reset;
                   This action transforms the current TCP packet according  to
                   the following pseudocode:

                   if (tcp.ack) {
                           tcp.seq = tcp.ack;
                   } else {
                           tcp.ack = tcp.seq + length(tcp.payload);
                           tcp.seq = 0;
                   }
                   tcp.flags = RST;

                   Then,  the  action  drops all TCP options and payload data,
                   and updates the TCP checksum. IP ttl is set to 255.

                   Prerequisite: tcp

              reject { action; ... };
                   If the original packet is IPv4 or IPv6 TCP packet,  it  re‚Äê
                   places it with IPv4 or IPv6 TCP RST packet and executes the
                   inner  actions.  Otherwise it replaces it with an ICMPv4 or
                   ICMPv6 packet and executes the inner actions.

                   The inner actions should not attempt  to  swap  eth  source
                   with  eth  destination and IP source with IP destination as
                   this action implicitly does that.

              trigger_event;
                   This action is used to allow ovs-vswitchd to report CMS re‚Äê
                   lated events writing them in Controller_Event table. It  is
                   possible  to  associate a meter to a each event in order to
                   not overload pinctrl thread under heavy load; each meter is
                   identified though a defined  naming  convention.  Supported
                   events:

                   ‚Ä¢      empty_lb_backends.  This  event  is  raised if a re‚Äê

                          that  has  no  configured  backend destinations. For
                          this event, the event info includes  the  load  bal‚Äê
                          ancer VIP, the load balancer UUID, and the transport
                          protocol. Associated meter: event-elb

              igmp;
                   This  action  sends the packet to ovn-controller for multi‚Äê

              bind_vport(V, P);
                   Parameters: logical port string field V  of  type  virtual,
                   logical port string field P.

                   Binds  the virtual logical port V and sets the chassis col‚Äê
                   umn and virtual_parent  of  the  table  Port_Binding.  vir‚Ä‚Äê
                   tual_parent is set to P.

              handle_svc_check(P);
                   Parameters: logical port string field P.

                   Handles  the service monitor reply received from the VIF of
                   the logical port P. ovn-controller periodically  sends  out
                   the  service monitor packets for the services configured in
                   the Service_Monitor table and this action updates the  sta‚Äê
                   tus of those services.

                   Example: handle_svc_check(inport);

              handle_dhcpv6_reply;
                   Handle DHCPv6 prefix delegation advertisements/replies from
                   a  IPv6 delegation server. ovn-controller will add an entry

              R = select(values=(N1[=W1], N2[=W2], ...);
              hash_fields="field1,field2,...");
                   Parameters: Integer N1, N2..., with optional weight W1, W2,
                   ...

                   Result: stored to a logical field or subfield R.

                   Select  from  a list of integers N1, N2..., each within the
                   range 0 ~ 65535, and store the selected one in the field R.
                   There must be 2 or more integers listed, each with  an  op‚Äê
                   tional  weight,  which  is  an integer within the range 1 ~
                   65535. If weight is not specified, it defaults to 100.  The
                   selection  method  is  based  on the 5-tuple hash of packet
                   header.

                   By default, dp_hash is used as the OpenFlow group selection
                   method, but if values and hash_fields are  specified,  hash
                   is  used as the selection method, and the fields listed are
                   used as the hash fields.

                   Processing automatically moves on to the next table, as  if
                   next;  were specified. The select action must be put as the
                   last action of the logical flow when there are multiple ac‚Äê
                   tions (actions put after select will not take effect).

                   Example: reg8[16..31] = select(1=20, 2=30, 3=50);  Example:
                   reg8[16..31]    =    select(values=(1=20,    2=30,   3=50);
                   hash_fields="ip_proto,src_ip,dst_ip");

              R = chk_lb_hairpin();
                   This  action  checks  if the packet under consideration was
                   destined to a load balancer VIP and it is hairpinned, i.e.,
                   after load balancing the destination IP matches the  source
                   IP.  If  it is so, then the 1-bit destination register R is
                   set to 1.

              R = chk_lb_hairpin_reply();
                   This action checks if the  packet  under  consideration  is
                   from  one  of the backend IP of a load balancer VIP and the
                   destination IP is the load balancer VIP. If it is so,  then
                   the 1-bit destination register R is set to 1.

              R = ct_snat_to_vip;
                   This  action  sends  the  packet  through  the SNAT zone to
                   change the source IP address of the packet to the load bal‚Äê
                   ancer VIP if the original destination IP was load  balancer
                   VIP  and  commits  the connection. This action applies suc‚Äê
                   cessfully only for the hairpinned traffic i.e if the action
                   chk_lb_hairpin returned success. This action  doesn‚Äôt  take
                   any arguments and it determines the SNAT IP internally. The
                   packet  is  not  automatically  sent to the next table. The
                   caller has to execute the  next;  action  explicitly  after
                   this action to advance the packet to the next stage.

              R = check_in_port_sec();
                   This action checks if the packet under consideration passes
                   the  inport  port  security checks. If the packet fails the
                   port security checks, then 1 is stored in  the  destination
                   register  R.  Else 0 is stored. The port security values to
                   check are retrieved from the the inport logical port.

                   This action should be used in the  ingress  logical  switch
                   pipeline.

                   Example: reg8[0..7] = check_in_port_sec();

              R = check_out_port_sec();
                   This action checks if the packet under consideration passes
                   the  outport  port security checks. If the packet fails the
                   port security checks, then 1 is stored in  the  destination
                   register  R.  Else 0 is stored. The port security values to
                   check are retrieved from the the outport logical port.

                   This action should be used in  the  egress  logical  switch
                   pipeline.

                   Example: reg8[0..7] = check_out_port_sec();

                   Parameters: IPv4/IPv6 traffic.

                   This  action  translates to an openflow "learn" action that
                   inserts two new flows in tables 76 and 77.

                   This action is applied if the packet arrives via ECMP route
                   or if it is routed via an ECMP route

              R = check_ecmp_nh_mac();
                   This  action  checks  if  the  packet  under  consideration
                   matches  any  flow in table 76. If it is so, then the 1-bit

              R = check_ecmp_nh();
                   This  action  checks  if  the  packet  under  consideration
                   matches  the  any  flow  in table 77. If it is so, then the
                   1-bit destination register R is set to 1.

                   This  action  translates to an openflow "learn" action that
                   inserts a new flow in table 78.

                   ‚Ä¢      Match on the 4-tuple in table 78: nw_src=ip  client,
                          nw_dst=vip  ip,  ip_proto,  tp_dst=vip  port and set
                          reg9[6] to 1, reg4 and reg8 to backend ip  and  port
                          respectively.  For  IPv6  register xxreg1 is used to
                          store the backend ip.

                   This action is applied for new connections  received  by  a
                   specific load-balacer with affinity timeout configured.

              R = chk_lb_aff();
                   This  action  checks  if  the  packet  under  consideration
                   matches any flow in table 78. If it is so, then  the  1-bit
                   destination register R is set to 1.

              R = ct_nw_dst();
                   This  action checks if the packet is tracked and stores the
                   conntrack original destination IPv4 address in the register
                   R of 32-bit size.

              R = ct_ip6_dst();
                   This action checks if the packet is tracked and stores  the
                   conntrack original destination IPv6 address in the register
                   R of 128-bit size.

              R = ct_tp_dst();
                   This  action checks if the packet is tracked and stores the
                   conntrack original L4 destination port in the register R of
                   16-bit size.

              R = ct_state_save();
                   This action checks if the packet is tracked and stores  the
                   conntrack original state in the 8-bit register R.

              sample(probability=packets, ...)
                   This  action causes the matched traffic to be sampled using
                   IPFIX protocol. More information about how  per-flow  IPFIX
                   sampling  works  in  OVS can be found in ovs-actions(7) and
                   ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5).

                   In order to reliably identify each sampled packet  when  it
                   is  received  by  the IPFIX collector, this action sets the
                   content of the ObservationDomainID  and  ObservationPointID
                   IPFIX fields (see argument description below).

                   The following key-value arguments are supported:

                   probability=packets
                          The  number of sampled packets out of 65535. It must
                          be greater or equal to 1.

                   collector_set=id
                          The unsigned 32-bit integer identifier of the sample
                          collector to send sampled packets to. It must  match
                          the  value  configured  in  the  Flow_Sample_Collec‚Ä‚Äê
                          tor_Set Table in OVS. Defaults to 0.

                   obs_domain=id
                          An unsigned 8-bit integer that identifies  the  sam‚Äê
                          pling  application.  It will be placed in the 8 most
                          significant bits of the ObservationDomainID field of
                          IPFIX samples. The 24 less significant bits will  be
                          automatically  filled  in with the datapath key. De‚Äê
                          faults to 0.

                   obs_point=id
                          An unsigned 32-bit integer to be used  as  Obsserva‚Ä‚Äê
                          tionPointID  or  the string @cookie to indicate that
                          the first 32 bits of the Logical_Flow‚Äôs  UUID  shall
                          be used instead.

              mac_cache_use;
                   This  action resubmits to corresponding table which updates
                   the use statistics of MAC cache.

              R = dhcp_relay_req_chk(relay-ip,
                   server-ip); Parameters: Logical Router  Port  IP  relay-ip,
                   DHCP Server IP server-ip.

                   Result: stored to a 1-bit subfield R.

                   This  action  executes on the source node on which the DHCP
                   request (DHCPDISCOVER or DHCPREQUEST) originated.

                   When this action applied successfully on the  DHCP  request
                   packet,  it updates GIADDR in the DHCP packet with relay-ip
                   and stores 1 in R.

                   When this action failed to apply on the packet,  it  leaves
                   the packet unchanged and stores 0 in R.

              R = dhcp_relay_resp_chk(relay-ip,
                   server-ip);  Parameters:  Logical  Router Port IP relay-ip,
                   DHCP Server IP server-ip.

                   Result: stored to a 1-bit subfield R.

                   This action executes on the first  node  (Redirect  Chassis
                   node) which processes the DHCP response(DHCPOFFER, DHCPACK)
                   from the DHCP server.

                   When  this action applied successfully on the DHCP response
                   packet, it updates the destination MAC and  destination  IP
                   in the packet and stores 1 in R. relay-ip and server-ip are
                   used  to validate GIADDR and SERVER-ID in the DHCP response
                   packet.

                   When this action failed to apply on the packet,  it  leaves
                   the packet unchanged and stores 0 in R.

              mirror(P);
                   Parameters: logical port string field P of type mirror.

                   When  using  an lport mirror, it clones the packet and out‚Äê
                   puts it to the local/remote chassis  through  the  mirrored
                   port P to the target port.

       tags: map of string-string pairs
              Key-value pairs that provide additional information to help ovn-
              controller  processing the logical flow. Below are the tags used
              by ovn-controller.

              in_out_port
                     In the logical flow‚Äôs "match" column, if a logical port P
                     is compared with "inport" and the logical flow  is  on  a
                     logical switch ingress pipeline, or if P is compared with
                     "outport"  and  the  logical  flow is on a logical switch
                     egress pipeline, and  the  expression  is  combined  with
                     other  expressions  (if  any) using the operator &&, then
                     the port P should be added as the value in this  tag.  If
                     there  are  multiple logical ports meeting this criteria,
                     one of them can be added. ovn-controller uses this infor‚Äê
                     mation to skip parsing flows that are not needed  on  the
                     chassis.  Failing  to add the tag will affect efficiency,
                     while adding wrong value will affect correctness.

       controller_meter: optional string
              The name of the meter in table Meter to be used for all  packets
              that the logical flow might send to ovn-controller.

       flow_desc: optional string
              Human-readable  explanation  of  the  flow, this is optional and
              used to provide context for the given flow.

       external_ids : stage-name: optional string
              Human-readable name for this flow‚Äôs stage in the pipeline.

       external_ids : stage-hint: optional string, containing an uuid
              UUID of an OVN_Northbound record that caused this  logical  flow
              to be created.

       external_ids : source: optional string
              Source  file and line number of the code that added this flow to
              the pipeline.

     Common Columns:

       The overall purpose of these columns is described under Common  Columns
       at the beginning of this document.

       external_ids: map of string-string pairs
Logical_DP_Group TABLE
       Each  row  in this table represents a group of logical datapaths refer‚Äê
       enced by the logical_dp_group column in the Logical_Flow table.

   Summary:
       datapaths                     set of weak reference  to  Datapath_Bind‚Ä‚Äê
                                     ings

   Details:
       datapaths: set of weak reference to Datapath_Bindings
              List of Datapath_Binding entries.

Multicast_Group TABLE
       The rows in this table define multicast groups of logical ports. Multi‚Äê
       cast groups allow a single packet transmitted over a tunnel to a hyper‚Äê
       visor  to  be  delivered to multiple VMs on that hypervisor, which uses
       bandwidth more efficiently.

       Each row in this table defines a logical multicast group numbered  tun‚Ä‚Äê
       nel_key  within  datapath,  whose logical ports are listed in the ports
       column.

   Summary:
       datapath                      Datapath_Binding
       tunnel_key                    integer, in range 32,768 to 65,535
       name                          string
       ports                         set of weak reference to Port_Bindings

   Details:
       datapath: Datapath_Binding
              The logical datapath in which the multicast group resides.

       tunnel_key: integer, in range 32,768 to 65,535
              The value used to designate this logical egress port  in  tunnel
              encapsulations.  An index forces the key to be unique within the
              datapath. The unusual range ensures that multicast group IDs  do
              not overlap with logical port IDs.

       name: string
              The  logical multicast group‚Äôs name. An index forces the name to
              be unique within the datapath.  Logical  flows  in  the  ingress
              pipeline  may output to the group just as for individual logical
              ports, by assigning the group‚Äôs name to outport and executing an
              output action.

              Multicast group names and logical  port  names  share  a  single
              namespace  and  thus should not overlap (but the database schema
              cannot enforce this). To try to avoid conflicts, ovn-northd uses
              names that begin with _MC_.

       ports: set of weak reference to Port_Bindings
              The logical ports included in the multicast group. All of  these
              ports must be in the datapath logical datapath (but the database
              schema cannot enforce this).

Mirror TABLE
       Each  row  in  this table represents a mirror that can be used for port
       mirroring. These mirrors are referenced by the mirror_rules  column  in
       the Port_Binding table.

   Summary:
       name                          string (must be unique within table)
       filter                        string,   one  of  both,  from-lport,  or
                                     to-lport
       sink                          string
       type                          string, one of  erspan,  gre,  local,  or
                                     lport
       index                         integer
       external_ids                  map of string-string pairs

   Details:
       name: string (must be unique within table)
              Represents the name of the mirror.

       filter: string, one of both, from-lport, or to-lport
              The  value  of  this  field represents selection criteria of the
              mirror. to-lport mirrors the packets coming into  logical  port.
              from-lport  mirrors  the packets going out of logical port. both
              mirrors for both directions.

       sink: string
              The value of this field represents the destination/sink  of  the
              mirror.  If  the  type is gre or erspan, the value indicates the
              tunnel remote IP (either IPv4 or IPv6). For  a  type  of  local,
              this  field  defines  a  local  interface on the OVS integration
              bridge to be used as the mirror destination. The interface  must
              possess external-ids:mirror-id that matches this string.

       type: string, one of erspan, gre, local, or lport
              The value of this field specifies the mirror type - gre, erspan,
              local or lport.

       index: integer
              The value of this field represents the tunnel ID. If the config‚Äê
              ured tunnel type is gre, this field represents the GRE key value
              and  if  the  configured tunnel type is erspan it represents the
              erspan_idx value. It is ignored if the type is local.

       external_ids: map of string-string pairs
              See External IDs at the beginning of this document.

Meter TABLE
       Each row in this table represents a meter that can be used for  QoS  or
       rate-limiting.

   Summary:
       name                          string (must be unique within table)
       unit                          string, either kbps or pktps
       bands                         set of 1 or more Meter_Bands

   Details:
       name: string (must be unique within table)
              A name for this meter.

              Names  that  begin  with "__" (two underscores) are reserved for
              OVN internal use and should not be added manually.

       unit: string, either kbps or pktps
              The unit for rate and burst_rate parameters in the bands  entry.
              kbps  specifies kilobits per second, and pktps specifies packets
              per second.

       bands: set of 1 or more Meter_Bands
              The bands associated with this meter. Each band specifies a rate
              above which the band is to take the action action.  If  multiple
              bands‚Äô  rates  are exceeded, then the band with the highest rate
              among the exceeded bands is selected.

Meter_Band TABLE
       Each row in this table represents a meter band which specifies the rate
       above which the configured action should be applied.  These  bands  are
       referenced by the bands column in the Meter table.

   Summary:
       action                        string, must be drop
       rate                          integer, in range 1 to 4,294,967,295
       burst_size                    integer, in range 0 to 4,294,967,295

   Details:
       action: string, must be drop
              The action to execute when this band matches. The only supported
              action is drop.

       rate: integer, in range 1 to 4,294,967,295
              The rate limit for this band, in kilobits per second or bits per
              second,  depending on whether the parent Meter entry‚Äôs unit col‚Äê
              umn specified kbps or pktps.

       burst_size: integer, in range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              The maximum burst allowed for the band in kilobits  or  packets,
              depending  on  whether  kbps or pktps was selected in the parent
              Meter entry‚Äôs unit column. If the size is zero,  the  switch  is
              free to select some reasonable value depending on its configura‚Äê
              tion.
Datapath_Binding TABLE
       Each  row in this table represents a logical datapath, which implements
       a logical pipeline among the ports in the Port_Binding table associated
       with it. In practice, the pipeline in a given logical  datapath  imple‚Äê
       ments either a logical switch or a logical router.

       The  main  purpose of a row in this table is provide a physical binding
       for a logical datapath. A logical datapath does not have a physical lo‚Äê
       cation, so its physical  binding  information  is  limited:  just  tun‚Ä‚Äê
       nel_key. The rest of the data in this table does not affect packet for‚Äê
       warding.

   Summary:
       tunnel_key                    integer,  in  range 1 to 16,777,215 (must
                                     be unique within table)

   Details:
       tunnel_key: integer, in range 1 to 16,777,215 (must be unique within
       table)
              The tunnel key value to which the logical datapath is bound. The
              Tunnel Encapsulation section  in  ovn-architecture(7)  describes
              how  tunnel  keys  are constructed for each supported encapsula‚Äê
              tion.

       load_balancers: set of uuids
              Not used  anymore;  kept  for  backwards  compatibility  of  the
              schema.

     OVN_Northbound Relationship:

       Each  row in Datapath_Binding is associated with some logical datapath.
       ovn-northd uses these keys to track the association of a logical  data‚Äê
       path with concepts in the OVN_Northbound database.

       type: optional string, either logical-router or logical-switch
              This represents the type of the northbound logical datapath that
              is represented by this southbound Datapath_Binding. The possible
              values for this are:

              ‚Ä¢      logical-switch

              ‚Ä¢      logical-router

       nb_uuid: optional uuid
              This  is  the UUID of the corresponding northbound logical data‚Äê
              path represented by this southbound Datapath_Binding.

       external_ids : interconn-ts: optional string
              For a logical datapath that represents  a  logical  switch  that
              represents  a  transit  switch  for  interconnection, ovn-northd
              stores in this key the value of the same interconn-ts key of the
              external_ids column of the corresponding Logical_Switch  row  in
              the OVN_Northbound database.

     Naming:

       ovn-northd  copies  these  from  the  name fields in the OVN_Northbound
       database, either from name and external_ids:neutron:router_name in  the
       Logical_Router table or from name and external_ids:neutron:network_name
       in the Logical_Switch table.

       external_ids : name: optional string
              A name for the logical datapath.

       external_ids : name2: optional string
              Another name for the logical datapath.

     Common Columns:

       The  overall purpose of these columns is described under Common Columns
       at the beginning of this document.

       external_ids: map of string-string pairs
Port_Binding TABLE
       Each row in this table binds a logical port to a realization. For  most
       logical  ports, this means binding to some physical location, for exam‚Äê
       ple by binding a logical port to a VIF that belongs to a VM running  on
       a  particular  hypervisor.  Other  logical ports, such as logical patch
       ports, can be realized without a specific physical location, but  their
       bindings are still expressed through rows in this table.

       For   every  Logical_Switch_Port  record  in  OVN_Northbound  database,
       ovn-northd creates a record in this  table.  ovn-northd  populates  and
       maintains  every  column except the chassis and virtual_parent columns,
       which it leaves empty in new records.

       ovn-controller/ovn-controller-vtep populates the chassis column for the
       records that identify the logical ports that are located on its  hyper‚Äê
       visor/gateway,  which  ovn-controller/ovn-controller-vtep in turn finds
       out by monitoring the local hypervisor‚Äôs Open_vSwitch  database,  which
       identifies  logical  ports  via  the  conventions described in Integra‚Ä‚Äê
       tionGuide.rst. (The exceptions are for Port_Binding records  with  type
       of  l3gateway, whose locations are identified by ovn-northd via the op‚Ä‚Äê
       tions:l3gateway-chassis column in this table. ovn-controller  is  still
       responsible to populate the chassis column.)

       ovn-controller  also  populates  the  virtual_parent  column of records
       whose type is virtual.

       When a chassis shuts down gracefully, it should clean  up  the  chassis
       column  that it previously had populated. (This is not critical because
       resources hosted on the chassis are equally unreachable  regardless  of
       whether  their rows are present.) To handle the case where a VM is shut
       down abruptly on one chassis, then brought up again on a different one,
       ovn-controller/ovn-controller-vtep must overwrite  the  chassis  column
       with new information.

     Core Features:

       datapath: Datapath_Binding
              The logical datapath to which the logical port belongs.

       logical_port: string (must be unique within table)
              A logical port. For a logical switch port, this  is  taken  from
              name in the OVN_Northbound database‚Äôs Logical_Switch_Port table.
              For  a  logical  router  port,  this  is  taken from name in the
              OVN_Northbound database‚Äôs Logical_Router_port table. (This means
              that logical switch ports and router port names must  not  share
              names in an OVN deployment.) OVN does not prescribe a particular
              format for the logical port ID.

       encap: optional weak reference to Encap
              Points to preferred encapsulation configuration to transmit log‚Äê
              ical  dataplane  packets to this chassis. The entry is reference
              to a Encap record.

       additional_encap: set of weak reference to Encaps
              Points to preferred encapsulation configuration to transmit log‚Äê
              ical dataplane packets to this additional chassis. The entry  is
              reference to a Encap record. See also additional_chassis.

       chassis: optional weak reference to Chassis
              The meaning of this column depends on the value of the type col‚Äê
              umn. This is the meaning for each type

              (empty string)
                     The  physical  location  of the logical port. To success‚Äê
                     fully identify a chassis, this column must be  a  Chassis
                     record. This is populated by ovn-controller.

              vtep   The  physical  location  of the hardware_vtep gateway. To
                     successfully identify a chassis, this column  must  be  a
                     Chassis record. This is populated by ovn-controller-vtep.

              localnet
                     Always  empty. A localnet port is realized on every chas‚Äê
                     sis that has connectivity to the  corresponding  physical
                     network.

              localport
                     Always  empty. A localport port is present on every chas‚Äê
                     sis.

              l3gateway
                     The physical location of the L3 gateway. To  successfully
                     identify a chassis, this column must be a Chassis record.
                     This is populated by ovn-controller based on the value of
                     the options:l3gateway-chassis column in this table.

              l2gateway
                     The physical location of this L2 gateway. To successfully
                     identify a chassis, this column must be a Chassis record.
                     This is populated by ovn-controller based on the value of
                     the options:l2gateway-chassis column in this table.

       additional_chassis: set of weak reference to Chassis
              The  meaning  of this column is the same as for the chassis. The
              column is used to track an additional physical location  of  the
              logical port. Used with regular (empty type) port bindings.

       gateway_chassis: set of Gateway_Chassises
              A list of Gateway_Chassis.

              This  should  only be populated for ports with type set to chas‚Ä‚Äê
              sisredirect. This column defines the list  of  chassis  used  as
              gateways where traffic will be redirected through.

       ha_chassis_group: optional HA_Chassis_Group
              This  should  only be populated for ports with type set to chas‚Ä‚Äê
              sisredirect. This column defines the HA  chassis  group  with  a
              list  of HA chassis used as gateways where traffic will be redi‚Äê
              rected through.

       up: optional boolean
              This is set to true whenever all  OVS  flows  required  by  this
              Port_Binding  have been installed. This is populated by ovn-con‚Ä‚Äê
              troller.

       tunnel_key: integer, in range 1 to 32,767
              A number that represents the logical port in the key (e.g.  Gen‚Äê
              eve TLV) field carried within tunnel protocol packets.

              The tunnel ID must be unique within the scope of a logical data‚Äê
              path.

       mac: set of strings
              This column is a misnomer as it may contain MAC addresses and IP
              addresses.  It  is copied from the addresses column in the Logi‚Ä‚Äê
              cal_Switch_Port table in the Northbound database. It follows the
              same format as that column.

       port_security: set of strings
              This column controls the addresses from which the host  attached
              to  the  logical  port (``the host‚Äô‚Äô) is allowed to send packets
              and to which it is allowed to receive packets. If this column is
              empty, all addresses are permitted.

              It  is  copied  from  the  port_security  column  in  the  Logi‚Ä‚Äê
              cal_Switch_Port table in the Northbound database. It follows the
              same format as that column.

       mirror_port: optional string
              Points to mirror target port fot lport mirror type.

       type: string
              A type for this logical port. Logical ports can be used to model
              other types of connectivity into an OVN logical switch. The fol‚Äê
              lowing types are defined:

              (empty string)
                     VM (or VIF) interface.

              patch  One  of  a pair of logical ports that act as if connected
                     by a patch cable. Useful for connecting two logical data‚Äê
                     paths, e.g. to connect a  logical  router  to  a  logical
                     switch or to another logical router.

              l3gateway
                     One  of  a pair of logical ports that act as if connected
                     by a patch cable across multiple chassis. Useful for con‚Äê
                     necting a logical switch with a Gateway router (which  is
                     only resident on a particular chassis).

              localnet
                     A   connection  to  a  locally  accessible  network  from
                     ovn-controller instances that have a corresponding bridge
                     mapping. A logical  switch  can  have  multiple  localnet
                     ports attached. This type is used to model direct connec‚Äê
                     tivity  to  existing networks. In this case, each chassis
                     should have a mapping for one of  the  physical  networks
                     only.  Note:  nothing  said  above implies that a chassis
                     cannot be plugged to multiple physical networks  as  long
                     as they belong to different switches.

              localport
                     A  connection  to  a local VIF. Traffic that arrives on a
                     localport is never forwarded over  a  tunnel  to  another
                     chassis.  These  ports  are  present on every chassis and
                     have the same address in all of them.  This  is  used  to
                     model  connectivity  to  local services that run on every
                     hypervisor.

              l2gateway
                     An L2 connection to a physical network. The chassis  this
                     Port_Binding  is  bound to will serve as an L2 gateway to
                     the network named by options:network_name.

              vtep   A port to a logical switch on a VTEP gateway chassis.  In
                     order  to  get  this port correctly recognized by the OVN
                     controller,  the  options:vtep-physical-switch  and   op‚Ä‚Äê
                     tions:vtep-logical-switch must also be defined.

              chassisredirect
                     A  logical  port  that  represents a particular instance,
                     bound to a specific chassis, of an otherwise  distributed
                     parent  port (e.g. of type patch). A chassisredirect port
                     should never be  used  as  an  inport.  When  an  ingress
                     pipeline sets the outport, it may set the value to a log‚Äê
                     ical  port  of  type chassisredirect. This will cause the
                     packet to be directed to a specific chassis to carry  out
                     the  egress  pipeline.  At  the  beginning  of the egress
                     pipeline, the outport will be reset to the value  of  the
                     distributed port.

              virtual
                     Represents  a  logical port with an virtual ip. This vir‚Ä‚Äê
                     tual ip can be configured on a logical port (which is re‚Äê
                     ferred as virtual parent).

       requested_chassis: optional weak reference to Chassis
              This column exists so that the  ovn-controller  can  effectively
              monitor  all Port_Binding records destined for it, and is a sup‚Äê
              plement to the options:requested-chassis option. The  option  is
              still  required so that the ovn-controller can check the CMS in‚Äê
              tent when the chassis pointed to does not currently exist, which
              for example occurs when the ovn-controller  is  stopped  without
              passing  the  -restart  argument.  This column must be a Chassis
              record. This is populated by  ovn-northd  when  the  options:re‚Ä‚Äê
              quested-chassis  is  defined  and contains a string matching the
              name or hostname of an existing chassis. See also  requested_ad‚Ä‚Äê
              ditional_chassis.

       requested_additional_chassis: set of weak reference to Chassis
              This  column  exists  so that the ovn-controller can effectively
              monitor all Port_Binding records destined for it, and is a  sup‚Äê
              plement  to  the  options:requested-chassis option when multiple
              chassis are listed. This  column  must  be  a  list  of  Chassis
              records.  This  is  populated by ovn-northd when the options:re‚Ä‚Äê
              quested-chassis is defined as a list of chassis names  or  host‚Äê
              names. See also requested_chassis.

       mirror_rules: set of weak reference to Mirrors
              Mirror rules that apply to the port binding. Please see the Mir‚Ä‚Äê
              ror table.

     Patch Options:

       These options apply to logical ports with type of patch.

       options : peer: optional string
              The  logical_port  in the Port_Binding record for the other side
              of the patch. The named logical_port  must  specify  this  logi‚Ä‚Äê
              cal_port  in its own peer option. That is, the two patch logical
              ports must have reversed logical_port and peer values.

       nat_addresses: set of strings
              MAC address followed by a list of SNAT and DNAT external IP  ad‚Äê
              dresses,  followed  by is_chassis_resident("lport"), where lport
              is the name of a logical port on the same chassis where the cor‚Äê
              responding NAT rules are applied. This is used  to  send  gratu‚Äê
              itous ARPs for SNAT and DNAT external IP addresses via localnet,
              from the chassis where lport resides. Example: 80:fa:5b:06:72:b7
              158.36.44.22   158.36.44.24   is_chassis_resident("foo1").  This
              would result in generation of gratuitous ARPs for  IP  addresses
              158.36.44.22   and   158.36.44.24   with   a   MAC   address  of
              80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 from the chassis where the logical port "foo1"
              resides.

     L3 Gateway Options:

       These options apply to logical ports with type of l3gateway.

       options : peer: optional string
              The logical_port in the Port_Binding record for the  other  side
              of  the  ‚Äôl3gateway‚Äô  port.  The named logical_port must specify
              this logical_port in its own  peer  option.  That  is,  the  two
              ‚Äôl3gateway‚Äô  logical  ports  must have reversed logical_port and
              peer values.

       options : l3gateway-chassis: optional string
              The chassis in which the port resides.

       nat_addresses: set of strings
              MAC address of the l3gateway port followed by a list of SNAT and
              DNAT external IP addresses. This is used to send gratuitous ARPs
              for SNAT and DNAT external IP addresses via  localnet.  Example:
              80:fa:5b:06:72:b7  158.36.44.22  158.36.44.24. This would result
              in generation of gratuitous ARPs for IP  addresses  158.36.44.22
              and  158.36.44.24  with a MAC address of 80:fa:5b:06:72:b7. This
              is used in OVS version 2.8 and later versions.

     Localnet Options:

       These options apply to logical ports with type of localnet.

       options : network_name: optional string
              Required.   ovn-controller   uses   the   configuration    entry
              ovn-bridge-mappings to determine how to connect to this network.
              ovn-bridge-mappings is a list of network names mapped to a local
              OVS  bridge  that provides access to that network. An example of
              configuring ovn-bridge-mappings would be: .IP
              $ ovs-vsctl set open . external-ids:ovn-bridge-mappings=physnet1:br-eth0,physnet2:br-eth1

              When a logical switch has a localnet port attached, every  chas‚Äê
              sis  that  may  have a local vif attached to that logical switch
              must have a bridge mapping configured to  reach  that  localnet.
              Traffic  that arrives on a localnet port is never forwarded over
              a tunnel to another chassis.  If  there  are  multiple  localnet
              ports  in a logical switch, each chassis should only have a sin‚Äê
              gle bridge mapping for one of the physical  networks.  Note:  In
              case  of  multiple  localnet ports, to provide interconnectivity
              between all VIFs located on  different  chassis  with  different
              fabric  connectivity,  the  fabric should implement some form of
              routing between the segments.

       tag: optional integer, in range 1 to 4,095
              If set, indicates that the port represents  a  connection  to  a
              specific  VLAN  on  a locally accessible network. The VLAN ID is
              used to match incoming traffic and is  also  added  to  outgoing
              traffic.

     L2 Gateway Options:

       These options apply to logical ports with type of l2gateway.

       options : network_name: optional string
              Required.    ovn-controller   uses   the   configuration   entry
              ovn-bridge-mappings to determine how to connect to this network.
              ovn-bridge-mappings is a list of network names mapped to a local
              OVS bridge that provides access to that network. An  example  of
              configuring ovn-bridge-mappings would be: .IP
              $ ovs-vsctl set open . external-ids:ovn-bridge-mappings=physnet1:br-eth0,physnet2:br-eth1

              When a logical switch has a l2gateway port attached, the chassis
              that  the  l2gateway port is bound to must have a bridge mapping
              configured to reach the network identified by network_name.

       options : l2gateway-chassis: optional string
              Required. The chassis in which the port resides.

       tag: optional integer, in range 1 to 4,095
              If set, indicates that the gateway is connected  to  a  specific
              VLAN  on  the physical network. The VLAN ID is used to match in‚Äê
              coming traffic and is also added to outgoing traffic.

     VTEP Options:

       These options apply to logical ports with type of vtep.

       options : vtep-physical-switch: optional string
              Required. The name of the VTEP gateway.

       options : vtep-logical-switch: optional string
              Required. A logical switch name connected by the  VTEP  gateway.
              Must be set when type is vtep.

     VMI (or VIF) Options:

       These options apply to logical ports with type having (empty string)

       options : requested-chassis: optional string
              If set, identifies a specific chassis (by name or hostname) that
              is  allowed  to  bind  this port. Using this option will prevent
              thrashing between two chassis trying to bind the same port  dur‚Äê
              ing  a live migration. It can also prevent similar thrashing due
              to a mis-configuration, if a port  is  accidentally  created  on
              more than one chassis.

              If set to a comma separated list, the first entry identifies the
              main  chassis  and  the  rest are one or more additional chassis
              that are allowed to bind the same port.

              When multiple chassis are set for  the  port,  and  the  logical
              switch  is  connected  to an external network through a localnet
              port, tunneling is enforced for the port to  guarantee  delivery
              of  packets  directed to the port to all its locations. This has
              MTU implications because the network  used  for  tunneling  must
              have MTU larger than localnet for stable connectivity.

       options : activation-strategy: optional string
              If  used  with multiple chassis set in requested-chassis, speci‚Äê
              fies an activation strategy for all additional chassis.  By  de‚Äê
              fault,  no  activation strategy is used, meaning additional port
              locations are immediately available for use. The option supports
              a comma separated  list  where  you  can  combine  3  protocols,
              "rarp",  "garp"  and "na". When any of the protocols is set, the
              port is blocked for ingress and  egress  communication  until  a
              specified protocol packet is sent from a new location. The acti‚Äê
              vation  strategy  is useful in live migration scenarios for vir‚Äê
              tual machines.

       options : additional-chassis-activated: optional string
              When activation-strategy is set, this option indicates that  the
              port was activated using the strategy specified.

       options : iface-id-ver: optional string
              If  set,  this port will be bound by ovn-controller only if this
              same key and value is configured in the external_ids  column  in
              the Open_vSwitch database‚Äôs Interface table.

       options : qos_min_rate: optional string
              If set, indicates the minimum guaranteed rate available for data
              sent from this interface, in bit/s.

       options : qos_max_rate: optional string
              If  set,  indicates the maximum rate for data sent from this in‚Äê
              terface, in bit/s. The traffic will be shaped according to  this
              limit.

       options : qos_burst: optional string
              If set, indicates the maximum burst size for data sent from this
              interface, in bits.

       options : qos_physical_network: optional string
              If  set,  indicates  the  name  of the egress network name where
              traffic shaping will be applied.

       options : qdisc_queue_id: optional string, containing an integer, in
       range 1 to 61,440
              Indicates the queue number on the physical device. This is  same
              as the queue_id used in OpenFlow in struct ofp_action_enqueue.

     Distributed Gateway Port Options:

       These  options  apply  to the distributed parent ports of logical ports
       with type of chasssisredirect.

       options : chassis-redirect-port: optional string
              The name of the chassis redirect port derived from this port  if
              this port is a distributed parent of a chassis redirect port.

     Chassis Redirect Options:

       These options apply to logical ports with type of chassisredirect.

       options : distributed-port: optional string
              The  name of the distributed port for which this chassisredirect
              port represents a particular instance.

       options : redirect-type: optional string
              The value is copied from the column options  in  the  OVN_North‚Äê
              bound  database‚Äôs  Logical_Router_Port table for the distributed
              parent of this port.

       options : always-redirect: optional string
              A boolean option that is set to true if the  distributed  parent
              of this chassis redirect port does not need distributed process‚Äê
              ing.

     Dynamic Routing:

       options : dynamic-routing-redistribute-local-only: optional string, ei‚Äê
       ther true or false
              Only relevant if options:dynamic-routing is set to true.

              This  controls  whether  ovn-controller  will  advertise  Adver‚Ä‚Äê
              tised_Route records only on the chassis where their tracked_port
              is bound. Default: false.

       options : dynamic-routing-no-learning: optional string, either true or
       false
              Only relevant if options:dynamic-routing is set to true.

              This option disables adding routes  to  Learned_Route  and  will
              also remove learned routes.

     Nested Containers:

       These columns support containers nested within a VM. Specifically, they
       are  used  when type is empty and logical_port identifies the interface
       of a container spawned inside a VM. They are empty  for  containers  or
       VMs that run directly on a hypervisor.

       parent_port: optional string
              This  is taken from parent_name in the OVN_Northbound database‚Äôs
              Logical_Switch_Port table.

       tag: optional integer, in range 1 to 4,095
              Identifies the VLAN tag in the network traffic  associated  with
              that container‚Äôs network interface.

              This  column is used for a different purpose when type is local‚Ä‚Äê
              net (see Localnet Options, above) or l2gateway (see  L2  Gateway
              Options, above).

     Virtual ports:

       virtual_parent: optional string
              This  column is set by ovn-controller with one of the value from
              the options:virtual-parents  in  the  OVN_Northbound  database‚Äôs
              Logical_Switch_Port table when the OVN action bind_vport is exe‚Äê
              cuted.  ovn-controller also sets the chassis column when it exe‚Äê
              cutes this action with its chassis id.

              ovn-controller sets this column only if the type is "virtual".

     Naming:

       external_ids : name: optional string
              For a logical switch port, ovn-northd copies  this  from  exter‚Ä‚Äê
              nal_ids:neutron:port_name  in  the  Logical_Switch_Port table in
              the OVN_Northbound database, if it is a nonempty string.

              For a logical switch port, ovn-northd  does  not  currently  set
              this key.

     Common Columns:

       external_ids: map of string-string pairs
              See External IDs at the beginning of this document.

              The  ovn-northd  program  populates this column with all entries
              into the external_ids column of the Logical_Switch_Port and Log‚Ä‚Äê
              ical_Router_Port tables of the OVN_Northbound database.

MAC_Binding TABLE
       Each row in this table specifies a binding from an  IP  address  to  an
       Ethernet  address  that  has  been discovered through ARP (for IPv4) or
       neighbor discovery (for IPv6). This table is primarily used to discover
       bindings on physical networks, because IP-to-MAC bindings  for  virtual
       machines are usually populated statically into the Port_Binding table.

       This  table  expresses  a  functional  relationship:  MAC_Binding(logi‚Ä‚Äê
       cal_port, ip) = mac.

       In outline, the lifetime of a logical router‚Äôs MAC binding  looks  like
       this:

              1.  On  hypervisor  1, a logical router determines that a packet
                  should be forwarded to IP address A on  one  of  its  router
                  ports.  It  uses  its logical flow table to determine that A
                  lacks a static IP-to-MAC binding and the get_arp  action  to
                  determine that it lacks a dynamic IP-to-MAC binding.

              2.  Using  an  OVN logical arp action, the logical router gener‚Äê
                  ates and sends a broadcast ARP request to the  router  port.
                  It drops the IP packet.

              3.  The  logical switch attached to the router port delivers the
                  ARP request to all of its ports. (It might make sense to de‚Äê
                  liver it only to ports that have no static  IP-to-MAC  bind‚Äê
                  ings, but this could also be surprising behavior.)

              4.  A host or VM on hypervisor 2 (which might be the same as hy‚Äê
                  pervisor  1)  attached to the logical switch owns the IP ad‚Äê
                  dress in question. It composes an ARP reply and unicasts  it
                  to the logical router port‚Äôs Ethernet address.

              5.  The  logical  switch  delivers  the ARP reply to the logical
                  router port.

              6.  The logical router flow table executes a put_arp action.  To
                  record  the  IP-to-MAC binding, ovn-controller adds a row to
                  the MAC_Binding table.

              7.  On  hypervisor  1,  ovn-controller  receives   the   updated
                  MAC_Binding table from the OVN southbound database. The next
                  packet  destined to A through the logical router is sent di‚Äê
                  rectly to the bound Ethernet address.

   Summary:
       logical_port                  string
       ip                            string
       mac                           string
       timestamp                     integer

              The logical port on which the binding was discovered.

       ip: string
              The bound IP address.

       mac: string
              The Ethernet address to which the IP is bound.

       timestamp: integer
              The timestamp in msec when the MAC binding was added or updated.
              Records that existed before this column will have 0.

       datapath: Datapath_Binding
              The logical datapath to which the logical port belongs.

DHCP_Options TABLE
       Each row in this table stores the DHCP Options supported by native  OVN
       DHCP.  ovn-northd populates this table with the supported DHCP options.
       ovn-controller looks up this table to get the DHCP codes  of  the  DHCP
       options  defined in the "put_dhcp_opts" action. Please refer to the RFC
       2132 "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2132" for  the  possible  list  of
       DHCP options that can be defined here.

              value: uint16
                     This  indicates  that  the value of the DHCP option is an
                     unsigned int16 (16 bits).

                     Example. "name=mtu", "code=26", "type=uint16".

              value: uint32
                     This indicates that the value of the DHCP  option  is  an
                     unsigned int32 (32 bits).

                     Example. "name=lease_time", "code=51", "type=uint32".

              value: static_routes
                     This indicates that the value of the DHCP option contains
                     a pair of IPv4 route and next hop addresses.

                     Example.    "name=classless_static_route",    "code=121",
                     "type=static_routes".

                     put_dhcp_opts(...,        classless_static_route        =
                     {30.0.0.0/24,10.0.0.4,0.0.0.0/0,10.0.0.1}...)

              value: str
                     This indicates that the value of the  DHCP  option  is  a
                     string.

                     Example. "name=host_name", "code=12", "type=str".

              value: host_id
                     This  indicates  that  the  value of the DHCP option is a
                     host_id. It can either be a host_name or an IP address.

                     Example. "name=tftp_server", "code=66", "type=host_id".

              value: domains
                     This indicates that the value of the DHCP option is a do‚Äê
                     main name or a comma separated list of domain names.

                     Example. "name=domain_search_list", "code=119", "type=do‚Äê
                     mains".
DHCPv6_Options TABLE
       Each row in this table stores the DHCPv6 Options  supported  by  native
       OVN  DHCPv6.  ovn-northd populates this table with the supported DHCPv6
       options. ovn-controller looks up this table to get the DHCPv6 codes  of
       the  DHCPv6 options defined in the put_dhcpv6_opts action. Please refer
       to RFC 3315 and RFC 3646 for the list of DHCPv6 options that can be de‚Äê

                     IPv6 address(es).

                     Example. "name=ia_addr", "code=5", "type=ipv6".

                     put_dhcpv6_opts(..., ia_addr = ae70::4,...)

              value: str
                     This indicates that the value of the DHCPv6 option  is  a
                     string.

                     Example. "name=domain_search", "code=24", "type=str".

                     put_dhcpv6_opts(..., domain_search = ovn.domain,...)

              value: mac
                     This  indicates  that the value of the DHCPv6 option is a
                     MAC address.

                     Example. "name=server_id", "code=2", "type=mac".

                     put_dhcpv6_opts(..., server_id = 01:02:03:04L05:06,...)
Connection TABLE
       Configuration for a database connection to  an  Open  vSwitch  database
       (OVSDB) client.

       This  table  primarily  configures  the  Open  vSwitch  database server
       (ovsdb-server).

       The Open vSwitch database server can initiate and maintain active  con‚Äê
       nections  to  remote  clients.  It can also listen for database connec‚Äê
       tions.

     Core Features:

       target: string (must be unique within table)
              Connection methods for clients.

              The following connection methods are currently supported:

              ssl:host[:port]
                     The specified SSL/TLS port on the given host,  which  can
                     either  be  a DNS name (if built with unbound library) or
                     an IP address. A valid SSL configuration must be provided
                     when this form is used, this configuration can be  speci‚Äê
                     fied via command-line options or the SSL table.

                     If port is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

                     SSL/TLS support is an optional feature that is not always
                     built as part of OVN or Open vSwitch.

              tcp:host[:port]
                     The  specified  TCP port on the given host, which can ei‚Äê
                     ther be a DNS name (if built with unbound library) or  an
                     IP  address  (IPv4  or IPv6). If host is an IPv6 address,
                     wrap it in square brackets, e.g. tcp:[::1]:6640.

                     If port is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

              pssl:[port][:host]
                     Listens for SSL/TLS  connections  on  the  specified  TCP
                     port. Specify 0 for port to have the kernel automatically
                     choose  an available port. If host, which can either be a
                     DNS name (if built with unbound library)  or  an  IP  ad‚Äê
                     dress,  is  specified, then connections are restricted to
                     the resolved or specified local IP address  (either  IPv4
                     or  IPv6  address).  If  host is an IPv6 address, wrap in
                     square brackets, e.g. pssl:6640:[::1].  If  host  is  not
                     specified then it listens only on IPv4 (but not IPv6) ad‚Äê
                     dresses.  A  valid SSL/TLS configuration must be provided
                     when this form is used, this can be specified either  via
                     command-line options or the SSL table.

                     If port is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

                     SSL/TLS support is an optional feature that is not always
                     built as part of OVN or Open vSwitch.

              ptcp:[port][:host]
                     Listens  for connections on the specified TCP port. Spec‚Äê
                     ify 0 for port to have the kernel automatically choose an
                     available port. If host, which can either be a  DNS  name
                     (if  built  with  unbound  library)  or an IP address, is
                     specified, then connections are  restricted  to  the  re‚Äê
                     solved or specified local IP address (either IPv4 or IPv6
                     address).  If  host is an IPv6 address, wrap it in square
                     brackets, e.g. ptcp:6640:[::1]. If host is not  specified
                     then it listens only on IPv4 addresses.

                     If port is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

              When  multiple clients are configured, the target values must be
              unique. Duplicate target values yield unspecified results.

       read_only: boolean
              true to restrict these connections  to  read-only  transactions,
              false to allow them to modify the database.

       role: string
              String containing role name for this connection entry.

     Client Failure Detection and Handling:

       max_backoff: optional integer, at least 1,000
              Maximum  number  of  milliseconds to wait between connection at‚Äê
              tempts. Default is implementation-specific.

       inactivity_probe: optional integer
              Maximum number of milliseconds of idle time on connection to the
              client before sending  an  inactivity  probe  message.  If  Open
              vSwitch  does  not communicate with the client for the specified
              number of seconds, it will send a probe. If a  response  is  not
              received  for  the  same additional amount of time, Open vSwitch
              assumes the connection has been broken and  attempts  to  recon‚Äê
              nect.  Default is implementation-specific. A value of 0 disables
              inactivity probes.

     Status:

       Key-value pair of is_connected is always updated. Other key-value pairs
       in the status columns may be updated depends on the target type.

       When target specifies a connection method that listens for inbound con‚Äê
       nections (e.g. ptcp: or punix:), both  n_connections  and  is_connected
       may also be updated while the remaining key-value pairs are omitted.

       On  the  other  hand, when target specifies an outbound connection, all
       key-value pairs may be updated, except  the  above-mentioned  two  key-
       value  pairs associated with inbound connection targets. They are omit‚Äê
       ted.

       is_connected: boolean
              true if currently connected to this client, false otherwise.

       status : last_error: optional string
              A human-readable description of the last error on the connection
              to the manager; i.e. strerror(errno). This key will  exist  only
              if an error has occurred.

       status : state: optional string, one of ACTIVE, BACKOFF, CONNECTING,
       IDLE, or VOID
              The state of the connection to the manager:

              VOID   Connection is disabled.

              BACKOFF
                     Attempting to reconnect at an increasing period.

              CONNECTING
                     Attempting to connect.

              ACTIVE Connected, remote host responsive.

              IDLE   Connection is idle. Waiting for response to keep-alive.

              These  values  may  change in the future. They are provided only
              for human consumption.

       status : sec_since_connect: optional string, containing an integer, at
       least 0
              The amount of time since this client last successfully connected
              to the database (in seconds). Value is empty if client has never
              successfully been connected.

       status : sec_since_disconnect: optional string, containing an integer,
       at least 0
              The amount of time since this client last disconnected from  the
              database  (in  seconds). Value is empty if client has never dis‚Äê
              connected.

       status : locks_held: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that  the  con‚Äê
              nection  holds.  Omitted  if  the  connection  does not hold any
              locks.

       status : locks_waiting: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that  the  con‚Äê
              nection  is currently waiting to acquire. Omitted if the connec‚Äê
              tion is not waiting for any locks.

       status : locks_lost: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that  the  con‚Äê
              nection  has  had  stolen by another OVSDB client. Omitted if no
              locks have been stolen from this connection.

       status : n_connections: optional string, containing an integer, at
       least 2
              When target specifies a connection method that listens  for  in‚Äê
              bound  connections  (e.g. ptcp: or pssl:) and more than one con‚Äê
              nection is actually active, the value is the  number  of  active
              connections. Otherwise, this key-value pair is omitted.

       status : bound_port: optional string, containing an integer
              When target is ptcp: or pssl:, this is the TCP port on which the
              OVSDB  server  is  listening.  (This is particularly useful when
              target specifies a port of 0, allowing the kernel to choose  any
              available port.)

       external_ids: map of string-string pairs

       other_config: map of string-string pairs
SSL TABLE
       SSL/TLS configuration for ovn-sb database access.

   Summary:
       private_key                   string
       certificate                   string

       Common Columns:
         external_ids                map of string-string pairs

   Details:
       private_key: string
              Name of a PEM file  containing  the  private  key  used  as  the
              switch‚Äôs identity for SSL/TLS connections to the controller.

       certificate: string
              Name  of a PEM file containing a certificate, signed by the cer‚Äê
              tificate authority (CA) used by the controller and manager, that
              certifies the switch‚Äôs private key,  identifying  a  trustworthy
              switch.

       ca_cert: string
              Name  of a PEM file containing the CA certificate used to verify
              that the switch is connected to a trustworthy controller.

       bootstrap_ca_cert: boolean
              If set to true, then Open vSwitch will attempt to obtain the  CA
              certificate  from the controller on its first SSL/TLS connection
              and save it to the named PEM file. If it is successful, it  will
              immediately  drop the connection and reconnect, and from then on
              all SSL/TLS connections must be authenticated by  a  certificate
              signed  by the CA certificate thus obtained. This option exposes
              the SSL/TLS connection to a man-in-the-middle  attack  obtaining
              the  initial  CA  certificate.  It may still be useful for boot‚Äê
              strapping.

       ssl_protocols: string
              Range or a comma- or space-delimited list of the SSL/TLS  proto‚Äê
              cols to enable for SSL/TLS connections.

              Supported  protocols  include TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3. Ranges can be
              provided in a form of two protocol names separated with  a  dash
              (TLSv1.2-TLSv1.3), or as a single protocol name with a plus sign
              (TLSv1.2+).  The value can be a list of protocols or exactly one
              range. The range is a preferred way of specifying protocols  and
              the  configuration  always  behaves  as if the range between the
              minimum and the maximum specified version is provided, i.e.,  if
              the  value  is  set to TLSv1.X,TLSv1.(X+2), the TLSv1.(X+1) will
              also be enabled as if it was a range. Regardless of  order,  the
              highest  protocol  supported  by  both sides will be chosen when
              making the connection.

              The default when this option is omitted is TLSv1.2+.

       ssl_ciphers: string
              List of ciphers (in OpenSSL cipher string  format)  to  be  sup‚Äê
              ported  for  SSL/TLS  connections with TLSv1.2. The default when
              this option is omitted is DEFAULT:@SECLEVEL=2.

       ssl_ciphersuites: string
              List of ciphersuites (in OpenSSL ciphersuites string format)  to
              be supported for SSL/TLS connections with TLSv1.3 and later. De‚Äê
              fault  value from OpenSSL will be used when this option is omit‚Äê
              ted.

HA_Chassis_Group TABLE
       Table representing a group of chassis which can provide High availabil‚Äê
       ity services. Each chassis in the group is  represented  by  the  table
       HA_Chassis.  The  HA  chassis  with highest priority will be the active
       chassis of this group. If the active chassis failover is detected,  the
       HA  chassis with the next higher priority takes over the responsibility
       of providing the HA. If ha_chassis_group column of the table Port_Bind‚Ä‚Äê
       ing references this table, then this  HA  chassis  group  provides  the
       gateway  functionality  and redirects the gateway traffic to the active

       riodically sends out service monitor packets and updates the status  of
       the service. If the service monitor is not local, then ovn-ic creates a
       record  about  it in the SBDB database, after which another OVN deploy‚Äê
       ment creates a record about the Service Monitor in  its  SBDB  and  the
       status  is propagated back to the initial record in the original avail‚Äê
       ability zone.

   Details:
     Configuration:

       ovn-northd sets these columns and values to configure the service moni‚Äê
       tor.

       type: optional string, either load-balancer or network-function
              The  type  of  the service. Supported values are "load-balancer"
              and "network-function".

       ip: string
              Destination IP used in monitor packets. For  load-balancer  ser‚Äê
              vice this is the IP of the service to be monitored. For network-
              function  service  this IP is used to send probe packets through
              the associated Network Function port pair.

       mac: string
              Destination MAC address used in monitor packets. This is applic‚Äê
              able only for network-function services.

       protocol: optional string, one of icmp, tcp, or udp
              The protocol of the service. For type  load-balancer,  supported
              protocols  are  tcp  and  udp. For type "network-function", sup‚Äê
              ported protocol is icmp, and the health probe is done by inject‚Äê
              ing an icmp echo request packet into  the  inport  of  the  Net‚Äê
              work_Function  and  then montoring the same packet coming out of
              the outport.

       port: integer, in range 0 to 65,535
              The TCP or UDP port of the service.

       logical_input_port: string
              This is applicable only for network-function type.  The  VIF  of
              the  logical  port on which monitor packets have to be sent. The
              ovn-controller that binds this logical_port monitors the service
              by sending periodic monitor packets.

       logical_port: string
              The VIF of the logical port on which the service is running. The
              ovn-controller that binds this logical_port monitors the service
              by sending periodic monitor packets. For load-balancer  this  is
              the  port  to  which monitor packets are sent and from which re‚Äê
              sponse packets are received. For network-function  this  is  the
              port from which the forwarded monitor packets are received.

       src_mac: string
              Source Ethernet address to use in the service monitor packet.

       src_ip: string
              Source  IPv4  or  IPv6  address  to  use  in the service monitor
              packet.

       chassis_name: string
              The name of the chassis where the logical port is bound.

       remote: boolean
              Set to true if backend locates on remote ovn deployment.

       ic_learned: boolean
              Set to true if the service monitor was propagated  from  another
              OVN deployment via ovn-ic management.

       options : interval: optional string, containing an integer
              The interval, in seconds, between service monitor checks.

       options : timeout: optional string, containing an integer
              The  time,  in  seconds,  after  which the service monitor check
              times out.

       options : success_count: optional string, containing an integer
              The number of successful checks after which the service is  con‚Äê
              sidered online.

       options : failure_count: optional string, containing an integer
              The  number of failure checks after which the service is consid‚Äê
              ered offline.

     Status Reporting:

       The ovn-controller on the chassis that hosts the  logical_port  updates
       this column to report the service‚Äôs status.

       status: optional string, one of error, offline, or online
              For  TCP  service, ovn-controller sends a SYN to the service and
              expects an ACK response to consider the service to be online.

              For UDP service, ovn-controller sends a UDP packet to  the  ser‚Äê
              vice and doesn‚Äôt expect any reply. If it receives an ICMP reply,
              then it considers the service to be offline.

       src_port: integer, in range 49,152 to 65,535
              udp source port used in bfd control  packets.  The  source  port
              MUST be in the range 49152 through 65535 (RFC5881 section 4).

       disc: integer
              A unique, nonzero discriminator value generated by the transmit‚Äê
              ting  system,  used to demultiplex multiple BFD sessions between
              the same pair of systems.

       logical_port: string
              OVN logical port when BFD engine is running.

       dst_ip: string
              BFD peer IP address.

       min_tx: integer
              This is the minimum interval, in milliseconds,  that  the  local
              system  would like to use when transmitting BFD Control packets,
              less any jitter applied. The value zero is reserved.

       min_rx: integer
              This is the minimum interval, in milliseconds, between  received
              BFD  Control  packets that this system is capable of supporting,
              less any jitter applied by the sender. If this  value  is  zero,
