NAME
       ovn-northd  and ovn-northd-ddlog - Open Virtual Network central control
       daemon

SYNOPSIS
       ovn-northd [options]

DESCRIPTION
       ovn-northd is a centralized  daemon  responsible  for  translating  the
       high-level  OVN  configuration into logical configuration consumable by
       daemons such as ovn-controller. It translates the logical network  con‐
       figuration  in  terms  of conventional network concepts, taken from the
       OVN Northbound Database (see ovn-nb(5)), into logical datapath flows in
       the OVN Southbound Database (see ovn-sb(5)) below it.

       ovn-northd is implemented in C. ovn-northd-ddlog is a compatible imple‐
       mentation written in DDlog, a language for  incremental  database  pro‐
       cessing.  This documentation applies to both implementations, with dif‐
       ferences indicated where relevant.

OPTIONS
       --ovnnb-db=database
              The OVSDB database containing the OVN  Northbound  Database.  If
              the  OVN_NB_DB environment variable is set, its value is used as
              the default. Otherwise, the default is unix:/ovnnb_db.sock.

       --ovnsb-db=database
              The OVSDB database containing the OVN  Southbound  Database.  If
              the  OVN_SB_DB environment variable is set, its value is used as
              the default. Otherwise, the default is unix:/ovnsb_db.sock.

       --ddlog-record=file
              This option is for ovn-north-ddlog only. It causes the daemon to
              record  the  initial database state and later changes to file in
              the text-based DDlog command format. The ovn_northd_cli  program
              can  later  replay  these  changes  for debugging purposes. This
              option has a performance impact. See debugging-ddlog.rst in  the
              OVN documentation for more details.

       --dry-run
              Causes   ovn-northd  to  start  paused.  In  the  paused  state,
              ovn-northd does not apply any changes to the databases, although
              it  continues  to  monitor  them.  For more information, see the
              pause command, under Runtime Management Commands below.

              For  ovn-northd-ddlog,  one   could   use   this   option   with
              --ddlog-record  to  generate  a  replay log without restarting a
              process or disturbing a running system.

       database in the above options must be an OVSDB active or  passive  con‐
       nection method, as described in ovsdb(7).

   Daemon Options
       --pidfile[=pidfile]
              Causes a file (by default, program.pid) to be created indicating
              the PID of the running process. If the pidfile argument  is  not
              specified, or if it does not begin with /, then it is created in
              .

              If --pidfile is not specified, no pidfile is created.

       --overwrite-pidfile
              By default, when --pidfile is specified and the  specified  pid‐
              file already exists and is locked by a running process, the dae‐
              mon refuses to start. Specify --overwrite-pidfile to cause it to
              instead overwrite the pidfile.

              When --pidfile is not specified, this option has no effect.

       --detach
              Runs  this  program  as a background process. The process forks,
              and in the child it starts a new session,  closes  the  standard
              file descriptors (which has the side effect of disabling logging
              to the console), and changes its current directory to  the  root
              (unless  --no-chdir is specified). After the child completes its
              initialization, the parent exits.

       --monitor
              Creates an additional process to monitor  this  program.  If  it
              dies  due  to a signal that indicates a programming error (SIGA‐
              BRT, SIGALRM, SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIGPIPE, SIGSEGV, SIGXCPU,
              or SIGXFSZ) then the monitor process starts a new copy of it. If
              the daemon dies or exits for another reason, the monitor process
              exits.

              This  option  is  normally used with --detach, but it also func‐
              tions without it.

       --no-chdir
              By default, when --detach is specified, the daemon  changes  its
              current  working  directory  to  the  root  directory  after  it
              detaches. Otherwise, invoking the daemon from a carelessly  cho‐
              sen  directory  would  prevent the administrator from unmounting
              the file system that holds that directory.

              Specifying --no-chdir suppresses this behavior,  preventing  the
              daemon  from changing its current working directory. This may be
              useful for collecting core files, since it is common behavior to
              write core dumps into the current working directory and the root
              directory is not a good directory to use.

              This option has no effect when --detach is not specified.

       --no-self-confinement
              By default this daemon will try to self-confine itself  to  work
              with  files  under  well-known  directories  determined at build
              time. It is better to stick with this default behavior  and  not
              to  use  this  flag  unless some other Access Control is used to
              confine daemon. Note that in contrast to  other  access  control
              implementations  that  are  typically enforced from kernel-space
              (e.g. DAC or MAC), self-confinement is imposed  from  the  user-
              space daemon itself and hence should not be considered as a full
              confinement strategy, but instead should be viewed as  an  addi‐
              tional layer of security.

       --user=user:group
              Causes  this  program  to  run  as a different user specified in
              user:group, thus dropping most of  the  root  privileges.  Short
              forms  user  and  :group  are also allowed, with current user or
              group assumed, respectively. Only daemons started  by  the  root
              user accepts this argument.

              On   Linux,   daemons   will   be   granted   CAP_IPC_LOCK   and
              CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICES before dropping root  privileges.  Daemons
              that  interact  with  a  datapath, such as ovs-vswitchd, will be
              granted three  additional  capabilities,  namely  CAP_NET_ADMIN,
              CAP_NET_BROADCAST  and  CAP_NET_RAW.  The capability change will
              apply even if the new user is root.

              On Windows, this option is not currently supported. For security
              reasons,  specifying  this  option will cause the daemon process
              not to start.

   Logging Options
       -v[spec]
       --verbose=[spec]
            Sets logging levels. Without any spec,  sets  the  log  level  for
            every  module and destination to dbg. Otherwise, spec is a list of
            words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from each
            category below:

            ·      A  valid module name, as displayed by the vlog/list command
                   on ovs-appctl(8), limits the log level change to the speci‐
                   fied module.

            ·      syslog,  console, or file, to limit the log level change to
                   only to the system log, to  the  console,  or  to  a  file,
                   respectively.  (If --detach is specified, the daemon closes
                   its standard file descriptors, so logging  to  the  console
                   will have no effect.)

                   On  Windows  platform,  syslog is accepted as a word and is
                   only useful along with the --syslog-target option (the word
                   has no effect otherwise).

            ·      off,  emer,  err,  warn,  info,  or dbg, to control the log
                   level. Messages of the given severity  or  higher  will  be
                   logged,  and  messages  of  lower severity will be filtered
                   out. off filters out all messages. See ovs-appctl(8) for  a
                   definition of each log level.

            Case is not significant within spec.

            Regardless  of the log levels set for file, logging to a file will
            not take place unless --log-file is also specified (see below).

            For compatibility with older versions of OVS, any is accepted as a
            word but has no effect.

       -v
       --verbose
            Sets  the  maximum  logging  verbosity level, equivalent to --ver‐
            bose=dbg.

       -vPATTERN:destination:pattern
       --verbose=PATTERN:destination:pattern
            Sets  the  log  pattern  for  destination  to  pattern.  Refer  to
            ovs-appctl(8) for a description of the valid syntax for pattern.

       -vFACILITY:facility
       --verbose=FACILITY:facility
            Sets  the RFC5424 facility of the log message. facility can be one
            of kern, user, mail, daemon, auth, syslog, lpr, news, uucp, clock,
            ftp,  ntp,  audit,  alert, clock2, local0, local1, local2, local3,
            local4, local5, local6 or local7. If this option is not specified,
            daemon  is  used  as  the  default for the local system syslog and
            local0 is used while sending a message to the target provided  via
            the --syslog-target option.

       --log-file[=file]
            Enables  logging  to a file. If file is specified, then it is used
            as the exact name for the log file. The default log file name used
            if file is omitted is /usr/local/var/log/ovn/program.log.

       --syslog-target=host:port
            Send  syslog messages to UDP port on host, in addition to the sys‐
            tem syslog. The host must be a numerical IP address, not  a  host‐
            name.

       --syslog-method=method
            Specify  method  as  how  syslog messages should be sent to syslog
            daemon. The following forms are supported:

            ·      libc, to use the libc syslog() function. Downside of  using
                   this  options  is that libc adds fixed prefix to every mes‐
                   sage before it is actually sent to the syslog  daemon  over
                   /dev/log UNIX domain socket.

            ·      unix:file, to use a UNIX domain socket directly. It is pos‐
                   sible to specify arbitrary message format with this option.
                   However,  rsyslogd  8.9  and  older versions use hard coded
                   parser function anyway that limits UNIX domain socket  use.
                   If  you  want  to  use  arbitrary message format with older
                   rsyslogd versions, then use  UDP  socket  to  localhost  IP
                   address instead.

            ·      udp:ip:port,  to  use  a UDP socket. With this method it is
                   possible to use arbitrary message format  also  with  older
                   rsyslogd.  When  sending  syslog  messages  over UDP socket
                   extra precaution needs to be taken into account, for  exam‐
                   ple,  syslog daemon needs to be configured to listen on the
                   specified UDP port,  accidental  iptables  rules  could  be
                   interfering  with  local  syslog traffic and there are some
                   security considerations that apply to UDP sockets,  but  do
                   not apply to UNIX domain sockets.

            ·      null, to discard all messages logged to syslog.

            The  default is taken from the OVS_SYSLOG_METHOD environment vari‐
            able; if it is unset, the default is libc.

   PKI Options
       PKI configuration is required in order to use SSL for  the  connections
       to the Northbound and Southbound databases.

              -p privkey.pem
              --private-key=privkey.pem
                   Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing the private key used as
                   identity for outgoing SSL connections.

              -c cert.pem
              --certificate=cert.pem
                   Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate  that  certi‐
                   fies the private key specified on -p or --private-key to be
                   trustworthy. The certificate must be signed by the certifi‐
                   cate  authority  (CA) that the peer in SSL connections will
                   use to verify it.

              -C cacert.pem
              --ca-cert=cacert.pem
                   Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate for ver‐
                   ifying certificates presented to this program by SSL peers.
                   (This may be the same certificate that  SSL  peers  use  to
                   verify the certificate specified on -c or --certificate, or
                   it may be a different one, depending on the PKI  design  in
                   use.)

              -C none
              --ca-cert=none
                   Disables  verification  of  certificates  presented  by SSL
                   peers. This introduces a security risk,  because  it  means
                   that  certificates  cannot be verified to be those of known
                   trusted hosts.

   Other Options
       --unixctl=socket
              Sets the name of the control socket on which program listens for
              runtime  management  commands  (see RUNTIME MANAGEMENT COMMANDS,
              below). If socket does not begin with /, it  is  interpreted  as
              relative  to  .  If  --unixctl  is  not used at all, the default
              socket is /program.pid.ctl, where pid is program’s process ID.

              On Windows a local named pipe is used to listen for runtime man‐
              agement  commands.  A  file  is  created in the absolute path as
              pointed by socket or if --unixctl is not used at all, a file  is
              created  as  program in the configured OVS_RUNDIR directory. The
              file exists just to mimic the behavior of a Unix domain socket.

              Specifying none for socket disables the control socket feature.



       -h
       --help
            Prints a brief help message to the console.

       -V
       --version
            Prints version information to the console.

RUNTIME MANAGEMENT COMMANDS
       ovs-appctl can send commands to a running ovn-northd process. The  cur‐
       rently supported commands are described below.

              exit   Causes ovn-northd to gracefully terminate.

              pause  Pauses ovn-northd. When it is paused, ovn-northd receives
                     changes  from  the  Northbound  and  Southbound  database
                     changes  as  usual,  but  it does not send any updates. A
                     paused ovn-northd also drops database locks, which allows
                     any other non-paused instance of ovn-northd to take over.

              resume Resumes  the  ovn-northd  operation to process Northbound
                     and Southbound database  contents  and  generate  logical
                     flows.  This  will also instruct ovn-northd to aspire for
                     the lock on SB DB.

              is-paused
                     Returns "true" if ovn-northd is currently paused, "false"
                     otherwise.

              status Prints  this  server’s status. Status will be "active" if
                     ovn-northd has acquired OVSDB lock on SB DB, "standby" if
                     it has not or "paused" if this instance is paused.

              sb-cluster-state-reset
                     Reset  southbound  database cluster status when databases
                     are destroyed and rebuilt.

                     If all databases in a clustered southbound  database  are
                     removed from disk, then the stored index of all databases
                     will be reset to zero. This will cause ovn-northd  to  be
                     unable  to  read  or  write  to  the southbound database,
                     because it will always detect the data as stale. In  such
                     a  case,  run  this command so that ovn-northd will reset
                     its local index so that it can interact with  the  south‐
                     bound database again.

              nb-cluster-state-reset
                     Reset  northbound  database cluster status when databases
                     are destroyed and rebuilt.

                     This performs the  same  task  as  sb-cluster-state-reset
                     except for the northbound database client.

       Only ovn-northd-ddlog supports the following commands:

              enable-cpu-profiling
              disable-cpu-profiling
                   Enables or disables profiling of CPU time used by the DDlog
                   engine. When CPU profiling is enabled, the profile  command
                   (see  below) will include DDlog CPU usage statistics in its
                   output. Enabling CPU profiling will slow  ovn-northd-ddlog.
                   Disabling  CPU  profiling  does  not  clear  any previously
                   recorded statistics.

              profile
                   Outputs a profile of the current and peak sizes of arrange‐
                   ments  inside  DDlog. This profiling data can be useful for
                   optimizing DDlog code.  If  CPU  profiling  was  previously
                   enabled  (even  if  it was later disabled), the output also
                   includes a CPU time profile. See Profiling inside the tuto‐
                   rial in the DDlog repository for an introduction to profil‐
                   ing DDlog.

ACTIVE-STANDBY FOR HIGH AVAILABILITY
       You may run ovn-northd more than once in an OVN deployment.  When  con‐
       nected  to  a  standalone or clustered DB setup, OVN will automatically
       ensure that only one of them is active at a time. If multiple instances
       of  ovn-northd  are running and the active ovn-northd fails, one of the
       hot standby instances of ovn-northd will automatically take over.

   Active-Standby with multiple OVN DB servers
       You may run multiple OVN DB servers in an OVN deployment with:

              ·      OVN DB servers deployed in active/passive mode  with  one
                     active and multiple passive ovsdb-servers.

              ·      ovn-northd  also  deployed on all these nodes, using unix
                     ctl sockets to connect to the local OVN DB servers.

       In such deployments, the ovn-northds on the passive nodes will  process
       the  DB  changes  and  compute  logical  flows  to be thrown out later,
       because write transactions  are  not  allowed  by  the  passive  ovsdb-
       servers. It results in unnecessary CPU usage.

       With  the  help  of  runtime  management  command  pause, you can pause
       ovn-northd on these nodes. When a passive node becomes master, you  can
       use  the  runtime management command resume to resume the ovn-northd to
       process the DB changes.

LOGICAL FLOW TABLE STRUCTURE
       One of the main purposes of ovn-northd is to populate the  Logical_Flow
       table  in  the  OVN_Southbound  database.  This  section  describes how
       ovn-northd does this for switch and router logical datapaths.

   Logical Switch Datapaths
     Ingress Table 0: Admission Control and Ingress Port Security - L2

       Ingress table 0 contains these logical flows:

              ·      Priority 100 flows to drop packets with VLAN tags or mul‐
                     ticast Ethernet source addresses.

              ·      Priority  50  flows  that implement ingress port security
                     for each enabled logical port. For logical ports on which
                     port  security is enabled, these match the inport and the
                     valid eth.src address(es) and advance only those  packets
                     to  the  next flow table. For logical ports on which port
                     security is not enabled, these advance all  packets  that
                     match the inport.

       There  are no flows for disabled logical ports because the default-drop
       behavior of logical flow tables causes packets that ingress  from  them
       to be dropped.

     Ingress Table 1: Ingress Port Security - IP

       Ingress table 1 contains these logical flows:

              ·      For  each  element in the port security set having one or
                     more IPv4 or IPv6 addresses (or both),

                     ·      Priority 90 flow to allow IPv4 traffic if  it  has
                            IPv4  addresses  which  match  the  inport,  valid
                            eth.src and valid ip4.src address(es).

                     ·      Priority 90 flow  to  allow  IPv4  DHCP  discovery
                            traffic  if it has a valid eth.src. This is neces‐
                            sary since DHCP discovery messages are  sent  from
                            the  unspecified  IPv4 address (0.0.0.0) since the
                            IPv4 address has not yet been assigned.

                     ·      Priority 90 flow to allow IPv6 traffic if  it  has
                            IPv6  addresses  which  match  the  inport,  valid
                            eth.src and valid ip6.src address(es).

                     ·      Priority 90 flow  to  allow  IPv6  DAD  (Duplicate
                            Address  Detection)  traffic  if  it  has  a valid
                            eth.src. This is is necessary  since  DAD  include
                            requires  joining  an  multicast group and sending
                            neighbor  solicitations  for  the  newly  assigned
                            address.  Since  no address is yet assigned, these
                            are sent from the unspecified IPv6 address (::).

                     ·      Priority 80 flow to drop IP (both IPv4  and  IPv6)
                            traffic which match the inport and valid eth.src.

              ·      One priority-0 fallback flow that matches all packets and
                     advances to the next table.

     Ingress Table 2: Ingress Port Security - Neighbor discovery

       Ingress table 2 contains these logical flows:

              ·      For each element in the port security set,

                     ·      Priority 90 flow to allow ARP traffic which  match
                            the  inport  and valid eth.src and arp.sha. If the
                            element has one or more IPv4  addresses,  then  it
                            also matches the valid arp.spa.

                     ·      Priority  90 flow to allow IPv6 Neighbor Solicita‐
                            tion and Advertisement  traffic  which  match  the
                            inport,  valid  eth.src  and nd.sll/nd.tll. If the
                            element has one or more IPv6  addresses,  then  it
                            also  matches  the valid nd.target address(es) for
                            Neighbor Advertisement traffic.

                     ·      Priority 80 flow to drop  ARP  and  IPv6  Neighbor
                            Solicitation and Advertisement traffic which match
                            the inport and valid eth.src.

              ·      One priority-0 fallback flow that matches all packets and
                     advances to the next table.

     Ingress Table 3: Lookup MAC address learning table

       This  table looks up the MAC learning table of the logical switch data‐
       path to check if the port-mac pair is present or  not.  MAC  is  learnt
       only  for  logical switch VIF ports whose port security is disabled and
       ’unknown’ address set.

              ·      For each such logical port p whose port security is  dis‐
                     abled and ’unknown’ address set following flow is added.

                     ·      Priority  100  flow with the match inport == p and
                            action  reg0[11]  =  lookup_fdb(inport,  eth.src);
                            next;

              ·      One priority-0 fallback flow that matches all packets and
                     advances to the next table.

     Ingress Table 4: Learn MAC of ’unknown’ ports.

       This table learns the MAC addresses seen on  the  logical  ports  whose
       port  security  is disabled and ’unknown’ address set if the lookup_fdb
       action returned false in the previous table.

              ·      For each such logical port p whose port security is  dis‐
                     abled and ’unknown’ address set following flow is added.

                     ·      Priority  100  flow  with the match inport == p &&
                            reg0[11] == 0 and action put_fdb(inport, eth.src);
                            next;  which stores the port-mac in the mac learn‐
                            ing table  of  the  logical  switch  datapath  and
                            advances the packet to the next table.

              ·      One priority-0 fallback flow that matches all packets and
                     advances to the next table.

     Ingress Table 5: from-lport Pre-ACLs

       This table prepares flows  for  possible  stateful  ACL  processing  in
       ingress  table  ACLs.  It  contains a priority-0 flow that simply moves
       traffic to the next table. If stateful ACLs are  used  in  the  logical
       datapath, a priority-100 flow is added that sets a hint (with reg0[0] =
       1; next;) for table Pre-stateful to send IP packets to  the  connection
       tracker  before  eventually advancing to ingress table ACLs. If special
       ports such as route ports or localnet ports can’t use  ct(),  a  prior‐
       ity-110 flow is added to skip over stateful ACLs. IPv6 Neighbor Discov‐
       ery and MLD traffic also skips  stateful  ACLs.  For  "allow-stateless"
       ACLs, a flow is added to bypass setting the hint for connection tracker
       processing.

       This table also has a priority-110 flow with the match eth.dst == E for
       all logical switch datapaths to move traffic to the next table. Where E
       is the service monitor mac defined in the options:svc_monitor_mac colum
       of NB_Global table.

     Ingress Table 6: Pre-LB

       This table prepares flows for possible stateful load balancing process‐
       ing in ingress table LB and Stateful. It  contains  a  priority-0  flow
       that  simply  moves  traffic  to the next table. Moreover it contains a
       priority-110 flow to move IPv6 Neighbor Discovery and  MLD  traffic  to
       the  next table. If load balancing rules with virtual IP addresses (and
       ports) are configured in OVN_Northbound database for a  logical  switch
       datapath, a priority-100 flow is added with the match ip to match on IP
       packets and sets the action reg0[2] = 1; next; to act as a hint for ta‐
       ble  Pre-stateful  to  send  IP  packets  to the connection tracker for
       packet de-fragmentation (and to possibly do  DNAT  for  already  estab‐
       lished  load  balanced  traffic) before eventually advancing to ingress
       table Stateful. If controller_event has been enabled and load balancing
       rules with empty backends have been added in OVN_Northbound, a 130 flow
       is added to trigger ovn-controller events whenever the chassis receives
       a  packet  for  that particular VIP. If event-elb meter has been previ‐
       ously created, it will be associated to the empty_lb logical flow

       Prior to OVN 20.09 we were setting the reg0[0] = 1 only if the IP  des‐
       tination  matches  the  load  balancer VIP. However this had few issues
       cases where a logical switch doesn’t have any ACLs  with  allow-related
       action.  To  understand  the  issue  lets  a take a TCP load balancer -
       10.0.0.10:80=10.0.0.3:80. If a logical port - p1  with  IP  -  10.0.0.5
       opens a TCP connection with the VIP - 10.0.0.10, then the packet in the
       ingress pipeline of ’p1’ is sent to the p1’s conntrack zone id and  the
       packet is load balanced to the backend - 10.0.0.3. For the reply packet
       from the backend lport, it is not sent  to  the  conntrack  of  backend
       lport’s  zone  id. This is fine as long as the packet is valid. Suppose
       the backend lport sends an invalid TCP packet (like incorrect  sequence
       number),  the packet gets delivered to the lport ’p1’ without unDNATing
       the packet to the VIP - 10.0.0.10. And this causes the connection to be
       reset by the lport p1’s VIF.

       We can’t fix this issue by adding a logical flow to drop ct.inv packets
       in the egress pipeline since it will drop  all  other  connections  not
       destined  to  the  load  balancers.  To fix this issue, we send all the
       packets to the conntrack in the ingress pipeline if a load balancer  is
       configured. We can now add a lflow to drop ct.inv packets.

       This table also has a priority-110 flow with the match eth.dst == E for
       all logical switch datapaths to move traffic to the next table. Where E
       is the service monitor mac defined in the options:svc_monitor_mac colum
       of NB_Global table.

       This table also has a priority-110 flow with the match inport == I  for
       all logical switch datapaths to move traffic to the next table. Where I
       is the peer of a logical router port. This flow is added  to  skip  the
       connection tracking of packets which enter from logical router datapath
       to logical switch datapath.

     Ingress Table 7: Pre-stateful

       This table prepares flows for all possible stateful processing in  next
       tables.  It contains a priority-0 flow that simply moves traffic to the
       next table.

              ·      Priority-120 flows that send the  packets  to  connection
                     tracker  using  ct_lb;  as the action so that the already
                     established traffic destined to  the  load  balancer  VIP
                     gets  DNATted  based  on  a hint provided by the previous
                     tables (with a match for reg0[2] == 1  and  on  supported
                     load  balancer  protocols and address families). For IPv4
                     traffic the flows also load the original  destination  IP
                     and  transport  port in registers reg1 and reg2. For IPv6
                     traffic the flows also load the original  destination  IP
                     and transport port in registers xxreg1 and reg2.

              ·      A  priority-110  flow  sends  the  packets  to connection
                     tracker based on a hint provided by the  previous  tables
                     (with  a  match  for  reg0[2]  ==  1) by using the ct_lb;
                     action. This flow is added to handle the traffic for load
                     balancer  VIPs  whose protocol is not defined (mainly for
                     ICMP traffic).

              ·      A priority-100  flow  sends  the  packets  to  connection
                     tracker  based  on a hint provided by the previous tables
                     (with a match for reg0[0] == 1)  by  using  the  ct_next;
                     action.

     Ingress Table 8: from-lport ACL hints

       This  table  consists of logical flows that set hints (reg0 bits) to be
       used in the next stage, in the ACL processing table, if  stateful  ACLs
       or  load  balancers  are  configured. Multiple hints can be set for the
       same packet. The possible hints are:

              ·      reg0[7]: the packet might match an allow-related ACL  and
                     might have to commit the connection to conntrack.

              ·      reg0[8]:  the packet might match an allow-related ACL but
                     there will be no need to commit the  connection  to  con‐
                     ntrack because it already exists.

              ·      reg0[9]: the packet might match a drop/reject.

              ·      reg0[10]:  the  packet  might match a drop/reject ACL but
                     the connection was previously allowed so it might have to
                     be committed again with ct_label=1/1.

       The table contains the following flows:

              ·      A priority-65535 flow to advance to the next table if the
                     logical switch has no ACLs configured, otherwise a prior‐
                     ity-0 flow to advance to the next table.

              ·      A priority-7 flow that matches on packets that initiate a
                     new session. This flow sets reg0[7] and reg0[9] and  then
                     advances to the next table.

              ·      A priority-6 flow that matches on packets that are in the
                     request direction of an already existing session that has
                     been  marked  as  blocked.  This  flow  sets  reg0[7] and
                     reg0[9] and then advances to the next table.

              ·      A priority-5 flow that matches  untracked  packets.  This
                     flow  sets  reg0[8]  and reg0[9] and then advances to the
                     next table.

              ·      A priority-4 flow that matches on packets that are in the
                     request direction of an already existing session that has
                     not been marked as blocked. This flow  sets  reg0[8]  and
                     reg0[10] and then advances to the next table.

              ·      A priority-3 flow that matches on packets that are in not
                     part of established sessions. This flow sets reg0[9]  and
                     then advances to the next table.

              ·      A  priority-2  flow that matches on packets that are part
                     of  an  established  session  that  has  been  marked  as
                     blocked.  This flow sets reg0[9] and then advances to the
                     next table.

                     of  an  established  session  that has not been marked as
                     blocked. This flow sets reg0[10] and then advances to the
                     next table.

     Ingress table 9: from-lport ACLs

       Logical flows in this table closely reproduce those in the ACL table in
       the OVN_Northbound database for the from-lport direction. The  priority
       values  from  the ACL table have a limited range and have 1000 added to
       them to leave room for OVN default flows at both higher and lower  pri‐
       orities.

                     for   UDP  connections,  and  sctp_abort  {output  <-%gt;
                     inport; next(pipeline=egress,table=5);} action  for  SCTP
                     associations.

              ·      Other  ACLs  translate to drop; for new or untracked con‐
                     nections and ct_commit(ct_label=1/1); for  known  connec‐
                     tions.  Setting  ct_label  marks a connection as one that
                     was previously allowed, but should no longer  be  allowed
                     due to a policy change.

       This  table contains a priority-65535 flow to advance to the next table
       if the logical switch has no ACLs configured,  otherwise  a  priority-0
       flow  to  advance  to  the  next  table  so  that ACLs allow packets by
       default.

       If the logical datapath has a stateful ACL or a load balancer with  VIP
       configured, the following flows will also be added:

              ·      A priority-1 flow that sets the hint to commit IP traffic
                     to the connection  tracker  (with  action  reg0[1]  =  1;

     Ingress Table 16: ARP/ND responder

       This  table  implements  ARP/ND responder in a logical switch for known
       IPs. The advantage of the ARP responder flow is to limit ARP broadcasts
       by locally responding to ARP requests without the need to send to other
       hypervisors. One common case is when the inport is a logical port asso‐
       ciated with a VIF and the broadcast is responded to on the local hyper‐
       visor rather than broadcast across the whole network and  responded  to
       by the destination VM. This behavior is proxy ARP.

       ARP  requests  arrive  from  VMs  from  a logical switch inport of type
       default. For this case, the logical switch proxy ARP rules can  be  for
       other  VMs  or logical router ports. Logical switch proxy ARP rules may
       be programmed both for mac binding of IP  addresses  on  other  logical
       switch  VIF  ports  (which are of the default logical switch port type,
       representing connectivity to VMs or containers), and for mac binding of
       IP  addresses  on  logical switch router type ports, representing their
       logical router port peers. In order to support proxy  ARP  for  logical
       router  ports,  an  IP address must be configured on the logical switch
       router type port, with the same value as the peer logical router  port.
       The configured MAC addresses must match as well. When a VM sends an ARP
       request for a distributed logical router port and if  the  peer  router
       type  port  of  the attached logical switch does not have an IP address
       configured, the ARP request will be broadcast on  the  logical  switch.
       One of the copies of the ARP request will go through the logical switch
       router type port to the logical  router  datapath,  where  the  logical
       router  ARP  responder will generate a reply. The MAC binding of a dis‐
       tributed logical router, once learned by an associated VM, is used  for
       all  that VM’s communication needing routing. Hence, the action of a VM
       re-arping for the mac binding of the  logical  router  port  should  be
       rare.

       Logical  switch  ARP  responder  proxy  ARP  rules can also be hit when
       receiving ARP requests externally on a L2 gateway port. In  this  case,
       the  hypervisor acting as an L2 gateway, responds to the ARP request on
       behalf of a destination VM.

       Note that ARP requests received from localnet or vtep  logical  inports
       can either go directly to VMs, in which case the VM responds or can hit
       an ARP responder for a logical router port if the  packet  is  used  to
       resolve a logical router port next hop address. In either case, logical
       switch ARP responder rules will not be hit. It contains  these  logical
       flows:

              ·      Priority-100 flows to skip the ARP responder if inport is
                     of type localnet or vtep and  advances  directly  to  the
                     next  table.  ARP requests sent to localnet or vtep ports
                     can be received by multiple hypervisors. Now, because the
                     same mac binding rules are downloaded to all hypervisors,
                     each of the multiple hypervisors will respond. This  will
                     confuse  L2  learning  on the source of the ARP requests.
                     ARP requests received on an inport of type router are not
                     expected  to  hit any logical switch ARP responder flows.
                     However, no skip flows are installed for  these  packets,
                     as  there would be some additional flow cost for this and

                     for  example,  an ARP request emitted by a VM for its own
                     IP address. A VM only  makes  this  kind  of  request  to
                     attempt  to  detect a duplicate IP address assignment, so
                     sending a reply will prevent the VM from accepting the IP
                     address that it owns.

                     In  place  of  next;, it would be reasonable to use drop;
                     for the flows’ actions. If everything is working as it is
                     configured,  then  this would produce equivalent results,
                     since no host should reply to the request. But ARPing for
                     one’s  own  IP  address  is intended to detect situations
                     where the network is not working as configured, so  drop‐
                     ping the request would frustrate that intent.

                     action get_fdb gets the port for the eth.dst in  the  MAC
                     learning  table  of the logical switch datapath. If there
                     is no entry for eth.dst in the MAC learning  table,  then
                     it stores none in the outport.

     Ingress Table 24 Destination unknown

       This  table  handles the packets whose destination was not found or and
       looked up in the MAC learning table of the logical switch datapath.  It
       contains the following flows.

              ·      If  the  logical  switch has logical ports with ’unknown’
                     addresses set, then the below logical flow is added

                            flow.

                     If the logical switch has no logical ports with ’unknown’
                     address set, then the below logical flow is added

                            and drops the packets.

                     the egress stage with the  outport  learnt  from  get_fdb
                     action.

     Egress Table 0: Pre-LB

       This table is similar to ingress table Pre-LB. It contains a priority-0
       flow that simply moves traffic to the next table. Moreover it  contains
       a priority-110 flow to move IPv6 Neighbor Discovery traffic to the next
       table. If any load balancing rules exist for  the  datapath,  a  prior‐
       ity-100  flow  is  added  with a match of ip and action of reg0[2] = 1;
       next; to act as a hint for table Pre-stateful to send IP packets to the
       connection  tracker  for  packet de-fragmentation and possibly DNAT the
       destination VIP to one of the selected  backend  for  already  commited
       load balanced traffic.

       This table also has a priority-110 flow with the match eth.src == E for
       all logical switch datapaths to move traffic to the next table. Where E
       is the service monitor mac defined in the options:svc_monitor_mac colum
       of NB_Global table.

     Egress Table 1: to-lport Pre-ACLs

       This is similar to ingress table Pre-ACLs except for to-lport traffic.

       This table also has a priority-110 flow with the match eth.src == E for
       all logical switch datapaths to move traffic to the next table. Where E
       is the service monitor mac defined in the options:svc_monitor_mac colum
       of NB_Global table.

       This table also has a priority-110 flow with the match outport == I for
       all logical switch datapaths to move traffic to the next table. Where I
       is  the  peer  of a logical router port. This flow is added to skip the
       connection tracking of packets which will be  entering  logical  router
       datapath from logical switch datapath for routing.

     Egress Table 2: Pre-stateful

       This  is  similar  to  ingress  table Pre-stateful. This table adds the
       below 3 logical flows.

              ·      A Priority-120 flow that send the packets  to  connection
                     tracker  using  ct_lb;  as the action so that the already
                     established traffic gets unDNATted from the backend IP to
                     the  load  balancer  VIP  based on a hint provided by the
                     previous tables with a match for reg0[2]  ==  1.  If  the
                     packet was not DNATted earlier, then ct_lb functions like
                     ct_next.

              ·      A priority-100  flow  sends  the  packets  to  connection
                     tracker  based  on a hint provided by the previous tables
                     (with a match for reg0[0] == 1)  by  using  the  ct_next;
                     action.

              ·      A  priority-0 flow that matches all packets to advance to
                     the next table.

     Egress Table 3: from-lport ACL hints

       This is similar to ingress table ACL hints.

     Egress Table 4: to-lport ACLs

       This is similar to ingress table ACLs except for to-lport ACLs.

       In addition, the following flows are added.

              ·      A priority 34000 logical flow is added for  each  logical
                     port which has DHCPv4 options defined to allow the DHCPv4
                     reply packet and which  has  DHCPv6  options  defined  to
                     allow  the DHCPv6 reply packet from the Ingress Table 16:
                     DHCP responses.

              ·      A priority 34000 logical flow is added for  each  logical
                     switch  datapath  configured  with  DNS  records with the
                     match udp.dst = 53 to allow the DNS reply packet from the
                     Ingress Table 18: DNS responses.

              ·      A  priority  34000 logical flow is added for each logical
                     switch datapath with the match eth.src = E to  allow  the
                     service  monitor  request  packet  generated  by ovn-con‐
                     troller with the action next, where E is the service mon‐
                     itor  mac defined in the options:svc_monitor_mac colum of
                     NB_Global table.

     Egress Table 5: to-lport QoS Marking

       This is similar to ingress table  QoS  marking  except  they  apply  to
       to-lport QoS rules.

     Egress Table 6: to-lport QoS Meter

       This  is  similar  to  ingress  table  QoS  meter  except they apply to
       to-lport QoS rules.

     Egress Table 7: Stateful

       This is similar to ingress table Stateful  except  that  there  are  no
       rules added for load balancing new connections.

     Egress Table 8: Egress Port Security - IP

       This  is similar to the port security logic in table Ingress Port Secu‐
       rity - IP except that outport, eth.dst, ip4.dst and ip6.dst are checked
       instead of inport, eth.src, ip4.src and ip6.src

     Egress Table 9: Egress Port Security - L2

       This  is  similar  to  the ingress port security logic in ingress table
       Admission Control and Ingress Port Security - L2,  but  with  important
       differences. Most obviously, outport and eth.dst are checked instead of
       inport and eth.src. Second, packets directed to broadcast or  multicast
       eth.dst  are always accepted instead of being subject to the port secu‐
       rity rules; this  is  implemented  through  a  priority-100  flow  that
       matches on eth.mcast with action output;. Moreover, to ensure that even
       broadcast and multicast packets are not delivered to  disabled  logical
       ports,  a priority-150 flow for each disabled logical outport overrides
       the priority-100 flow with a drop; action. Finally if  egress  qos  has
       been  enabled  on a localnet port, the outgoing queue id is set through
       set_queue action. Please remember to mark  the  corresponding  physical
       interface with ovn-egress-iface set to true in external_ids

   Logical Router Datapaths
       Logical router datapaths will only exist for Logical_Router rows in the
       OVN_Northbound database that do not have enabled set to false

     Ingress Table 0: L2 Admission Control

       This table drops packets that the router shouldn’t see at all based  on
       their Ethernet headers. It contains the following flows:

              ·      Priority-100 flows to drop packets with VLAN tags or mul‐
                     ticast Ethernet source addresses.

              ·      For each enabled router port P with Ethernet address E, a
                     priority-50  flow  that matches inport == P && (eth.mcast
                     || eth.dst == E), stores the router port ethernet address
                     and  advances  to next table, with action xreg0[0..47]=E;
                     next;.

                     For the gateway port  on  a  distributed  logical  router
                     (where  one of the logical router ports specifies a gate‐
                     way chassis), the above flow matching  eth.dst  ==  E  is
                     only programmed on the gateway port instance on the gate‐
                     way chassis.

              ·      For each dnat_and_snat NAT rule on a  distributed  router
                     that  specifies  an external Ethernet address E, a prior‐
                     ity-50 flow that matches inport == GW &&  eth.dst  ==  E,
                     where  GW is the logical router gateway port, with action
                     xreg0[0..47]=E; next;.

                     This flow is only programmed on the gateway port instance
                     on  the  chassis  where the logical_port specified in the
                     NAT rule resides.

       Other packets are implicitly dropped.

     Ingress Table 1: Neighbor lookup

       For ARP and IPv6 Neighbor Discovery packets, this table looks into  the
       MAC_Binding  records  to  determine if OVN needs to learn the mac bind‐
       ings. Following flows are added:

                     received  for  the  router’s  IP  address. Let A be an IP
                     address owned by a router port. Then, for each A that  is
                     an IPv4 address, a priority-90 flow matches on ip4.dst ==

                     && icmp6.code == 0 (ICMPv6 echo request). The port of the
                     router that receives the echo request  does  not  matter.
                     Also,  the  ip.ttl  of  the  echo  request  packet is not
                     checked, so it complies with RFC 1812,  section  4.2.2.9.
                     Flows for ICMPv4 echo requests use the following actions:

                     router that is not already handled by one  of  the  flows
                     above,  which  amounts to ICMP (other than echo requests)
                     and fragments with nonzero offsets. For each IP address A
                     owned  by  the router, a priority-60 flow matches ip4.dst
                     == A or ip6.dst == A and drops the traffic. An  exception
                     is  made  and  the  above flow is not added if the router
                     port’s own IP address is used  to  SNAT  packets  passing
                     through that router.

       The flows above handle all of the traffic that might be directed to the
       router itself. The following flows (with lower priorities)  handle  the
       remaining traffic, potentially for forwarding:

     Ingress Table 4: DEFRAG

       This is to send packets to connection tracker for tracking and  defrag‐
       mentation.  It  contains a priority-0 flow that simply moves traffic to
       the next table.

       If load balancing rules with virtual IP addresses (and ports) are  con‐
       figured in OVN_Northbound database for a Gateway router, a priority-100
       flow is added for each configured virtual IP address VIP. For IPv4 VIPs
       the  flow matches ip && ip4.dst == VIP. For IPv6 VIPs, the flow matches
       ip && ip6.dst == VIP. The flow uses the  action  ct_next;  to  send  IP
       packets  to  the  connection  tracker  for  packet de-fragmentation and
       tracking before sending it to the next table.

       If ECMP routes with symmetric reply are configured  in  the  OVN_North‐
       bound  database  for a gateway router, a priority-300 flow is added for
       each router port on which symmetric replies are configured. The  match‐
       ing  logic for these ports essentially reverses the configured logic of
       the ECMP route. So for instance, a route  with  a  destination  routing
       policy  will  instead match if the source IP address matches the static
       route’s prefix. The flow uses the action ct_next to send IP packets  to
       the  connection tracker for packet de-fragmentation and tracking before
       sending it to the next table.

     Ingress Table 5: UNSNAT

       This is for already established  connections’  reverse  traffic.  i.e.,
       SNAT  has  already  been done in egress pipeline and now the packet has
       entered the ingress pipeline as part of a reply. It is unSNATted here.

                     also present as an external_ip in the NAT table, a prior‐

     Ingress Table 10: IP Routing

       A packet that arrives at this table is an  IP  packet  that  should  be
       routed  to  the address in ip4.dst or ip6.dst. This table implements IP
       routing, setting reg0 (or xxreg0 for IPv6) to the next-hop  IP  address
       (leaving ip4.dst or ip6.dst, the packet’s final destination, unchanged)
       and advances to the next table for ARP resolution. It  also  sets  reg1
       (or  xxreg1)  to  the  IP  address  owned  by  the selected router port
       (ingress table ARP Request will generate an  ARP  request,  if  needed,
       with  reg0 as the target protocol address and reg1 as the source proto‐
       col address).

       For ECMP routes, i.e. multiple static routes with same policy and  pre‐
       fix  but different nexthops, the above actions are deferred to next ta‐
       ble. This table, instead, is responsible for determine the  ECMP  group
       id and select a member id within the group based on 5-tuple hashing. It
       stores group id in reg8[0..15] and member id in reg8[16..31]. This step
       is  skipped  if  the traffic going out the ECMP route is reply traffic,
       and the ECMP route was configured to use  symmetric  replies.  Instead,
       the  stored ct_label value is used to choose the destination. The least
       significant 48 bits of the ct_label tell the destination MAC address to
       which  the  packet  should  be  sent. The next 16 bits tell the logical
       router port on which the packet should be sent.  These  values  in  the
       ct_label  are set when the initial ingress traffic is received over the
       ECMP route.

                     group  that  will  eventually  flood  the  traffic to all
                     interested attached  logical  switches.  The  flows  also

                     that have options :mcast_flood=’true’. If no router ports

                     is an exempted_ext_ip and the action is next; . This flow
                     is  used  to bypass the ct_snat action for a packet which

       Egress Table 1: SNAT on Distributed Routers

              ·      For each configuration in the  OVN  Northbound  database,
                     that  asks  to  change  the source IP address of a packet
                     from an IP address of  A  or  to  change  the  source  IP
                     address  of  a  packet  that belongs to network A to B, a
                     flow matches ip && ip4.src == A && outport ==  GW,  where
                     GW  is  the  logical  router gateway port, with an action
                     ct_snat(B);. The priority of the flow is calculated based
                     on  the  mask of A, with matches having larger masks get‐
                     ting higher priorities.  If  the  NAT  rule  is  of  type
                     dnat_and_snat and has stateless=true in the options, then
                     the action would be ip4/6.src= (B).

                     If the NAT rule cannot be handled in a  distributed  man‐
                     ner,  then the flow above is only programmed on the gate‐
                     way chassis increasing flow priority by 128 in  order  to
                     be run first

                     If  the  NAT rule can be handled in a distributed manner,
                     then there is an additional action eth.src =  EA;,  where
                     EA is the ethernet address associated with the IP address
                     A in the NAT rule. This allows upstream MAC  learning  to
                     point to the correct chassis.

                     If  the  NAT  rule  has  allowed_ext_ips configured, then
                     there is an additional match ip4.dst == allowed_ext_ips .
                     Similarly,   for   IPV6,   match   would  be  ip6.dst  ==
                     allowed_ext_ips.

                     If the NAT rule has exempted_ext_ips set, then  there  is
                     an additional flow configured at the priority + 1 of cor‐
                     responding NAT rule. The flow matches if  destination  ip
                     is an exempted_ext_ip and the action is next; . This flow
                     is used to bypass the ct_snat action for a flow which  is
                     destinted to exempted_ext_ips.

     Egress Table 2: Egress Loopback

       For  distributed  logical routers where one of the logical router ports
       specifies a gateway chassis.

       While UNDNAT and SNAT processing have already occurred by  this  point,
       this  traffic  needs  to be forced through egress loopback on this dis‐
       tributed gateway port instance, in order for UNSNAT and DNAT processing
       to  be applied, and also for IP routing and ARP resolution after all of
       the NAT processing, so that the packet can be forwarded to the destina‐
       tion.

       This table has the following flows:

              ·      For  each  NAT  rule  in the OVN Northbound database on a
                     distributed router,  a  priority-100  logical  flow  with
                     match  ip4.dst  == E && outport == GW && is_chassis_resi‐
                     dent(P), where E is the external IP address specified  in
                     the  NAT rule, GW is the logical router distributed gate‐
                     way port. For dnat_and_snat NAT rule, P  is  the  logical
                     port specified in the NAT rule. If logical_port column of
                     NAT table is NOT set, then P is the chassisredirect  port
                     of GW with the following actions:

                     clone {
                         ct_clear;
                         inport = outport;
                         outport = "";
                         flags = 0;
                         flags.loopback = 1;
                         reg0 = 0;
                         reg1 = 0;
                         ...
                         reg9 = 0;
                         REGBIT_EGRESS_LOOPBACK = 1;
                         next(pipeline=ingress, table=0);
                     };


                     flags.loopback  is set since in_port is unchanged and the
                     packet may return back to that port after NAT processing.
                     REGBIT_EGRESS_LOOPBACK  is  set  to  indicate that egress
                     loopback has occurred, in order to  skip  the  source  IP
                     address check against the router address.
