NAME
       ovn-nb - OVN_Northbound database schema

       This  database  is  the  interface between OVN and the cloud management
       system (CMS), such as OpenStack, running above it. The CMS produces al‚Äê
       most all of the contents of the database. The ovn-northd program  moni‚Äê
       tors  the  database  contents,  transforms  it,  and stores it into the
       OVN_Southbound database.

       We generally speak of ``the‚Äô‚Äô CMS, but one  can  imagine  scenarios  in
       which multiple CMSes manage different parts of an OVN deployment.

   External IDs
       Each  of  the  tables in this database contains a special column, named
       external_ids. This column has the same form and purpose each  place  it
       appears.

              external_ids: map of string-string pairs
                     Key-value  pairs  for  use  by the CMS. The CMS might use
                     certain pairs, for example, to identify entities  in  its
                     own  configuration that correspond to those in this data‚Äê
                     base.

   Details:
     Identity:

       name: string
              The  name  of the OVN cluster, which uniquely identifies the OVN
              cluster throughout all OVN  clusters  supposed  to  interconnect
              with each other.

     Status:

       These  columns  allow a client to track the overall configuration state
       of the system.

       nb_cfg: integer
              Sequence number for client to increment. When a client  modifies
              any  part of the northbound database configuration and wishes to
              wait for ovn-northd and possibly all of the hypervisors to  fin‚Äê
              ish applying the changes, it may increment this sequence number.

       nb_cfg_timestamp: integer
              The  timestamp, in milliseconds since the epoch, when ovn-northd
              sees the latest nb_cfg and starts processing.

              To print the timestamp as a human-readable date:

                        date -d "@$(ovn-nbctl get NB_Global . nb_cfg_timestamp | sed ‚Ä‚Äôs/...$//‚Ä‚Äô)"


       sb_cfg: integer
              Sequence number that ovn-northd sets to the value of nb_cfg  af‚Äê
              ter it finishes applying the corresponding configuration changes
              to the OVN_Southbound database.

       sb_cfg_timestamp: integer
              The  timestamp, in milliseconds since the epoch, when ovn-northd
              finishes applying the corresponding configuration changes to the
              OVN_Southbound database successfully.

       hv_cfg: integer
              Sequence number that ovn-northd sets to  the  smallest  sequence
              number  of  all  the  chassis  in the system, as reported in the
              Chassis_Private table in the southbound database.  Thus,  hv_cfg
              equals  nb_cfg  if all chassis are caught up with the northbound
              configuration (which may never happen, if any chassis is  down).
              This value can regress, if a chassis was removed from the system
              and rejoins before catching up.

              If  there  are  no  chassis,  then  ovn-northd  copies nb_cfg to
              hv_cfg. Thus, in this case, the  (nonexistent)  hypervisors  are
              always  considered  to be caught up. This means that hypervisors
              can be "caught up" even in cases where sb_cfg  would  show  that
              the southbound database is not. To detect when both the hypervi‚Äê
              sors  and the southbound database are caught up, a client should
              take the smaller of sb_cfg and hv_cfg.

       hv_cfg_timestamp: integer
              The largest timestamp, in milliseconds since the epoch,  of  the
              smallest  sequence  number  of all the chassis in the system, as
              reported in the Chassis_Private table in  the  southbound  data‚Äê
              base.  In other words, this timestamp reflects the time when the
              slowest chassis catches up with  the  northbound  configuration,
              which  is  useful  for end-to-end control plane latency measure‚Äê
              ment.

     Common Columns:

       external_ids: map of string-string pairs
              See External IDs at the beginning of this document.

     Common options:

       options: map of string-string pairs
              This column provides general key/value settings.  The  supported
              options are described individually below.

     Options for configuring OVS BFD:

       These  options  apply when ovn-controller configures OVS BFD on tunnels
       interfaces. Please note these parameters refer to legacy OVS BFD imple‚Äê
       mentation and not to OVN BFD one.

       options : bfd-min-rx: optional string
              BFD option min-rx value to use when configuring  BFD  on  tunnel
              interfaces.

       options : bfd-decay-min-rx: optional string
              BFD  option  decay-min-rx  value  to use when configuring BFD on
              tunnel interfaces.

       options : bfd-min-tx: optional string
              BFD option min-tx value to use when configuring  BFD  on  tunnel
              interfaces.

       options : bfd-mult: optional string
              BFD  option mult value to use when configuring BFD on tunnel in‚Äê
              terfaces.

       options : ignore_chassis_features: optional string
              When set to false, the ovn-northd  will  evaluate  the  features
              supported  by  each chassis and will only activate features that
              are universally supported by all chassis. This approach is  cru‚Äê
              cial  for  maintaining  backward compatibility during an upgrade
              when the ovn-northd is updated prior to the ovn-controller. How‚Äê
              ever, if any chassis is poorly managed and the upgrade is unsuc‚Äê
              cessful, it will restrict ovn-northd  from  activating  the  new
              features.

              Alternatively,  setting this option to true instructs ovn-northd
              to bypass the support status of features on each chassis and  to
              directly implement the latest features. This approach safeguards
              the  operation  of ovn-northd from being adversely affected by a
              mismatched configuration of a chassis.

              The default setting for this option is false.

       options : mac_prefix: optional string
              Configure a given OUI to be used as prefix when  L2  address  is
              dynamically assigned, e.g. 00:11:22

       options : mac_binding_removal_limit: optional string, containing an in‚Äê
       teger, in range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              MAC  binding aging bulk removal limit. This limits how many rows
              can expire in a single transaction. Default value is 0 which  is
              unlimited.  When  we hit the limit next batch removal is delayed
              by 5 s.

       options : fdb_removal_limit: optional string, containing an integer, in
       range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              FDB aging bulk removal limit. This limits how many rows can  ex‚Äê
              pire in a single transaction. Default value is 0 which is unlim‚Äê
              ited.  When  we hit the limit next batch removal is delayed by 5
              s.

       options : controller_event: optional string, either true or false
              Value set by the CMS to enable/disable ovn-controller event  re‚Äê
              porting.  Traffic  into  OVS can raise a ‚Äôcontroller‚Äô event that
              results  in  a  Controller_Event  being  written  to  the   Con‚Ä‚Äê
              troller_Event table in SBDB. When the CMS has seen the event and
              taken appropriate action, it can remove the corresponding row in
              Controller_Event  table.  The  intention is for a CMS to see the
              events and take  some  sort  of  action.  Please  see  the  Con‚Ä‚Äê
              troller_Event table in SBDB. It is possible to associate a meter
              to each controller event type in order to not overload the pinc‚Äê
              trl  thread  under heavy load. Each event type relies on a meter
              with a defined name:

              ‚Ä¢      empty_lb_backends: event-elb

       options : northd_probe_interval: optional string
              The inactivity probe interval  of  the  connection  to  the  OVN
              Northbound  and  Southbound  databases  from ovn-northd, in mil‚Äê
              liseconds. If the value is  zero,  it  disables  the  connection
              keepalive feature.

              If the value is nonzero, then it will be forced to a value of at
              least 1000 ms.

       options : ic_probe_interval: optional string
              The  inactivity  probe  interval  of  the  connection to the OVN
              Northbound and Southbound databases from  ovn-ic,  in  millisec‚Äê
              onds. If the value is zero, it disables the connection keepalive
              feature.

              If the value is nonzero, then it will be forced to a value of at
              least 1000 ms.

       options : nbctl_probe_interval: optional string
              The  inactivity  probe  interval  of  the  connection to the OVN
              Northbound database from ovn-nbctl utility, in milliseconds.  If
              the value is zero, it disables the connection keepalive feature.

              If the value is nonzero, then it will be forced to a value of at
              least 1000 ms.

              If  the  value  is  less  than zero, then the default inactivity
              probe interval for ovn-nbctl would be left intact (120000 ms).

       options : northd_trim_timeout: optional string
              When used, this configuration value specifies the time, in  mil‚Äê
              liseconds,  since  the  last  ovn-northd  active operation after
              which memory trimming is performed. By default this  is  set  to
              30000 (30 seconds).

       options : use_logical_dp_groups: optional string
              Note:  This option is deprecated, the only behavior is to always
              combine logical flows by datapath groups. Changing the value  or
              removing this option all toghether will have no effect.

              ovn-northd  combines  logical flows that differs only by logical
              datapath into a single logical flow with logical datapath  group
              attached.

       options : use_parallel_build: optional string
              If set to true, ovn-northd will attempt to compute logical flows
              in parallel.

              Parallel computation is enabled only if the system has 4 or more
              cores/threads available to be used by ovn-northd.

              The default value is false.

       options : ignore_lsp_down: optional string
              If  set  to  false,  ARP/ND reply flows for logical switch ports
              will be installed only if the port is  up,  i.e.  claimed  by  a
              Chassis. If set to true, these flows are installed regardless of
              the status of the port, which can result in a situation that ARP
              request  to  an  IP is resolved even before the relevant VM/con‚Äê
              tainer is running. For environments where this is not an  issue,
              setting  it  to true can reduce the load and latency of the con‚Äê
              trol plane. The default value is true.

       options : use_ct_inv_match: optional string
              If set to false, ovn-northd will not use the ct.inv field in any
              of the logical flow matches. The default value is true.  If  the
              NIC  supports  offloading OVS datapath flows but doesn‚Äôt support
              offloading ct_state inv flag, then the datapath  flows  matching
              on  this  flag  (either +inv or -inv) will not be offloaded. CMS
              should consider setting use_ct_inv_match to false in such cases.
              This results in a side effect of the invalid packets getting de‚Äê
              livered to the destination VIF, which otherwise would have  been
              dropped by OVN.

       options : default_acl_drop: optional string
              If set to true., ovn-northd will generate a logical flow to drop
              all  traffic in the ACL stages. By default this option is set to
              false.

       options : debug_drop_domain_id: optional string
              If set to a 8-bit number and if debug_drop_collector_set is also
              configured, ovn-northd will add a sample action to every logical
              flow that contains a ‚Äôdrop‚Äô action. The 8 most significant  bits
              of  the  observation_domain_id  field will be those specified in
              the  debug_drop_domain_id. The 24 least significant bits of  the
              observation_domain_id field will be the datapath‚Äôs key.

              The observation_point_id will be set to the first 32 bits of the
              logical flow‚Äôs UUID.

              Note: This key is deprecated in favor of the value configured in
              the Sampling_App table for the drop application.

       options : debug_drop_collector_set: optional string
              If set to a 32-bit number ovn-northd will add a sample action to
              every logical flow that contains a ‚Äôdrop‚Äô action. The sample ac‚Äê
              tion  will  have  the specified collector_set_id. The value must
              match that of  the  local  OVS  configuration  as  described  in
              ovs-actions(7).

       options : use_common_zone: optional string, either true or false
              Default value is false. If set to true the SNAT and DNAT happens
              in  common zone, instead of happening in separate zones, depend‚Äê
              ing on the configuration. However, this  option  breaks  traffic
              when  there  is configuration of DGP + LB + SNAT on this LR. The
              value true should be used only in  case  of  HWOL  compatibility
              with GDP.

       options : northd-backoff-interval-ms: optional string
              Maximum  interval  that the northd incremental engine is delayed
              by in milliseconds. Setting the value to nonzero delays the next
              northd engine run by the previous run time, capped by the speci‚Äê
              fied value. If the value is zero the engine won‚Äôt be delayed  at
              all.  The recommended period is smaller than 500 ms, beyond that
              the latency of SB changes would be very noticeable.

       options : vxlan_mode: optional string
              By default if at least one chassis in OVN cluster has VXLAN  en‚Äê
              cap,  northd  will  run  in  a VXLAN mode. See man ovn-architec‚Äê
              ture(7) Tunnel Encapsulations paragraph  for  more  details.  In
              case  VXLAN encaps are needed on chassis only to support HW VTEP
              functionality and main encap type is GENEVE, set this option  to
              false to use default non-VXLAN mode tunnel IDs allocation logic.
              Please consider when OVN is running in OVN-interconnect mode and
              it  is  using  VXLAN  encapsulation type, the max number of non-
              transit logical switches and logical routers is reduced to 1024.
              Plese note, in order to enable VXLAN encapsulation type for  for
              cross-AZ  traffic,  vxlan_mode  parameter  in IC_NB_Global TABLE
              must be set to true.

       options : always_tunnel: optional string, either true or false
              If set to true, then the traffic destined to a VIF of a provider
              logical switch (having a localnet port) will  be  tunnelled  in‚Äê
              stead  of  sending it via the localnet port. This option will be
              useful if CMS wants to connect overlay logical switches (without
              localnet port) and provider logical switches to a router.  With‚Äê
              out  this  option  set,  the  traffic path will be a mix of tun‚Äê
              nelling and localnet ports (since routing  is  distributed)  re‚Äê
              sulting in the leakage of the router port mac address to the up‚Äê
              stream  switches  and  undefined behavior if NATting is involed.
              This option is disabled by default.

       options : ecmp_nexthop_monitor_enable: optional string
              If set to true., ovn-northd will create entries in  ECMP_Nexthop
              TABLE  to  track ECMP routes created with --ecmp_symmetric_reply
              option. By default this option is set to false.

       options : enable_chassis_nb_cfg_update: optional string
              If set to false,  ovn-controllers  will  no  longer  update  the
              nb_cfg column in the Chassis_Private table of the OVN_Southbound
              database.  They will still update the external_ids:ovn-nb-cfg in
              the local OVS integration bridge. By defailt this option is  set
              to true.

     Options for services health check confguration:

       These  options  are  used  when  health  configuration  is  enabled for
       Load_Balancer and Network_Function services.

       options : svc_monitor_mac: optional string
              MAC Address used as the Ethernet source in health check  probes.
              If unspecified, a MAC address is automatically generated.

       options : svc_monitor_mac_dst: optional string
              MAC  Address  used  as  the Ethernet destination in health check
              probes. If unspecified, a MAC address  is  automatically  gener‚Äê
              ated.  This applies only to Network Function health check probes
              deployed in inline mode.

       options : svc_monitor_ip: optional string
              IP Address (IPv4 or IPv6) used as the  source  in  health  check
              probes.  This  applies  only  to  Network  Function health check
              probes deployed in inline mode.

       options : svc_monitor_ip_dst: optional string
              IP Address (IPv4 or IPv6) used  as  the  destination  in  health
              check probes. This applies only to Network Function health check
              probes deployed in inline mode.

     Options for configuring interconnection route advertisement:

       These options control how routes are advertised between OVN deployments
       for  interconnection. If enabled, ovn-ic from different OVN deployments
       exchanges routes between each other through  the  global  OVN_IC_South‚Ä‚Äê
       bound  database.  Only  routers with ports connected to interconnection
       transit switches participate in route advertisement. For each of  these
       routers, there are three types of routes to be advertised:

       Firstly, the static routes configured in the router are advertised.

       Secondly,  the networks configured in the logical router ports that are
       not on the transit switches are advertised. These are considered as di‚Äê
       rectly connected subnets on the router.

       Thirdly, the vips of the load balancers  associated  with  the  logical
       router are advertised.

       Link  local prefixes (IPv4 169.254.0.0/16 and IPv6 FE80::/10) are never
       advertised.

       The learned routes are added to the static_routes column of  the  Logi‚Ä‚Äê
       cal_Router table, with external_ids:ic-learned-route set to the uuid of
       the row in Route table of the OVN_IC_Southbound database.

       options : ic-route-adv: optional string
              A  boolean  value that enables route advertisement to the global
              OVN_IC_Southbound database. Default is false.

       options : ic-route-learn: optional string
              A boolean value that enables  route  learning  from  the  global
              OVN_IC_Southbound database. Default is false.

       options : ic-route-adv-default: optional string
              A  boolean  value  that enables advertising default route to the
              global OVN_IC_Southbound database. Default is false. This option
              takes effect only when option ic-route-adv is true.

       options : ic-route-learn-default: optional string
              A boolean value that enables learning  default  route  from  the
              global OVN_IC_Southbound database. Default is false. This option
              takes effect only when option ic-route-learn is true.

       options : ic-route-adv-lb: optional string
              A  boolean  value  that enables advertising routes for load bal‚Äê
              ancer vips to the global OVN_IC_Southbound database. Default  is
              false. This option takes effect only when option ic-route-adv is
              true.

       options : ic-route-learn-lb: optional string
              A  boolean  value that enables learning routes for load balancer
              routes from the global OVN_IC_Southbound  database.  Default  is
              false.  This option takes effect only when option ic-route-learn
              is true.

       options : ic-route-denylist: optional string
              A string value contains a list of  CIDRs  delimited  by  ",".  A
              route  will  not  be advertised or learned if the route‚Äôs prefix
              belongs to any of the CIDRs listed.

     Connection Options:

       connections: set of Connections
              Database clients to  which  the  Open  vSwitch  database  server
              should  connect or on which it should listen, along with options
              for how these connections should be configured. See the  Connec‚Ä‚Äê
              tion table for more information.

       ssl: optional SSL
              Global SSL/TLS configuration.

     Security Configurations:

       ipsec: boolean
              Tunnel  encryption  configuration.  If  this column is set to be
              true, all OVN tunnels will be encrypted with IPsec.

     Read-only Options:

       options : max_tunid: optional string
              The maximum supported tunnel ID. Depends on types of  encapsula‚Äê
              tion enabled in the cluster.

Logical_Switch TABLE
       Each row represents one L2 logical switch.

       There  are two kinds of logical switches, that is, ones that fully vir‚Äê
       tualize the network (overlay logical switches) and  ones  that  provide
       simple  connectivity  to  physical networks (bridged logical switches).
       They work in the same way when providing connectivity  between  logical
       ports  on  same chassis, but differently when connecting remote logical
       ports. Overlay logical switches connect remote logical  ports  by  tun‚Äê
       nels,  while  bridged  logical  switches provide connectivity to remote
       ports by bridging the packets to directly connected  physical  L2  seg‚Äê
       ments  with the help of localnet ports. Each bridged logical switch has
       one or more localnet ports, which have only  one  special  address  un‚Ä‚Äê
       known.

   Details:
       ports: set of Logical_Switch_Ports
              The logical ports connected to the logical switch.

              It is an error for multiple logical switches to include the same
              logical port.

       load_balancer: set of weak reference to Load_Balancers
              Set of load balancers associated to this logical switch.

       load_balancer_group: set of Load_Balancer_Groups
              Set of load balancers groups associated to this logical switch.

       acls: set of ACLs
              Access  control  rules  that apply to packets within the logical
              switch.

       qos_rules: set of QoSes
              QoS marking and metering rules that apply to packets within  the
              logical switch.

       dns_records: set of weak reference to DNSes
              This column defines the DNS records to be used for resolving in‚Äê
              ternal  DNS  queries within the logical switch by the native DNS
              resolver. Please see the DNS table.

       forwarding_groups: set of Forwarding_Groups
              Groups a set of logical port endpoints for traffic going out  of
              the logical switch.

     Naming:

       These columns provide names for the logical switch. From OVN‚Äôs perspec‚Äê
       tive, these names have no special meaning or purpose other than to pro‚Äê
       vide  convenience  for human interaction with the database. There is no
       requirement for the name to be unique. (For a unique identifier  for  a
       logical switch, use its row UUID.)

       (Originally, name was intended to serve the purpose of a human-friendly
       name,  but the Neutron integration used it to uniquely identify its own
       switch object, in the format neutron-uuid. Later  on,  Neutron  started
       propagating  the friendly name of a switch as external_ids:neutron:net‚Ä‚Äê
       work_name. Perhaps this can be cleaned up someday.)

       name: string
              A name for the logical switch.

       external_ids : neutron:network_name: optional string
              Another name for the logical switch.

       other_config : dynamic-routing-bridge-ifname: optional string
              Set the interface name for the bridge used for EVPN integration.
              The default name is br-$vni. Only relevant  if  other_config:dy‚Ä‚Äê
              namic-routing-vni is set to valid VNI.

       other_config : dynamic-routing-vxlan-ifname: optional string
              List of interface names used for the vxlan devices used for EVPN
              integration.  The  default  name is vxlan-$vni. Only relevant if
              other_config:dynamic-routing-vni is set to valid VNI.

       other_config : dynamic-routing-advertise-ifname: optional string
              Set the interface name for the advertise device  used  for  EVPN
              integration.  The  default  name  is  lo-$vni.  Only relevant if
              other_config:dynamic-routing-vni is set to valid VNI.

     IP Address Assignment:

       These options control automatic IP address management (IPAM) for  ports
       attached to the logical switch. To enable IPAM for IPv4, set other_con‚Ä‚Äê
       fig:subnet  and optionally other_config:exclude_ips. To enable IPAM for
       IPv6, set other_config:ipv6_prefix. IPv4 and IPv6 may  be  enabled  to‚Äê
       gether or separately.

       To  request  dynamic  address assignment for a particular port, use the
       dynamic  keyword  in  the  addresses  column  of   the   port‚Äôs   Logi‚Ä‚Äê
       cal_Switch_Port row. This requests both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address, if
       IPAM for IPv4 and IPv6 are both enabled.

       other_config : subnet: optional string
              Set  this  to  an  IPv4  subnet,  e.g. 192.168.0.0/24, to enable
              ovn-northd to automatically assign IP addresses within that sub‚Äê
              net.

       other_config : exclude_ips: optional string
              To exclude some addresses from automatic IP address  management,
              set  this to a list of the IPv4 addresses or ..-delimited ranges
              to exclude. The addresses or ranges should be a subset of  those
              in other_config:subnet.

              Whether  listed or not, ovn-northd will never allocate the first
              or  last  address  in  a  subnet,   such   as   192.168.0.0   or
              192.168.0.255 in 192.168.0.0/24.

              Examples:

              ‚Ä¢      192.168.0.2 192.168.0.10

              ‚Ä¢      192.168.0.4                    192.168.0.30..192.168.0.60
                     192.168.0.110..192.168.0.120

              ‚Ä¢      192.168.0.110..192.168.0.120   192.168.0.25..192.168.0.30
                     192.168.0.144

       other_config : ipv6_prefix: optional string
              Set this to an IPv6 prefix to enable ovn-northd to automatically
              assign  IPv6  addresses using this prefix. The assigned IPv6 ad‚Äê
              dress will be generated using the IPv6 prefix and  the  MAC  ad‚Äê
              dress  (converted  to an IEEE EUI64 identifier) of the port. The
              IPv6 prefix defined here should be a valid IPv6  address  ending
              with ::.

              Examples:

              ‚Ä¢      aef0::

              ‚Ä¢      bef0:1234:a890:5678::

       other_config : dhcp_relay_port: optional string
              If  set  to the name of logical switch port of type router then,
              DHCP Relay is enabled for this logical switch provided the  cor‚Äê
              responding Logical_Router_Port has DHCP Relay configured.

       other_config : mac_only: optional string, either true or false
              Value  used to request to assign L2 address only if neither sub‚Äê
              net nor ipv6_prefix are specified

       other_config : fdb_age_threshold: optional string, containing an inte‚Äê
       ger, in range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              FDB aging threshold value in seconds. FDB exceeding this timeout
              will be automatically removed. The value defaults  to  0,  which
              means disabled.

       other_config : ct-zone-limit: optional string, containing an integer,
       in range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              CT zone limit value for given Logical_Switch. This value will be
              propagated  to  all Logical_Switch_Port when configured, but can
              be overwritten individually per Logical_Switch_Port. The value 0
              means unlimited. When the option is not present the limit is not
              set and the zone limit is  derived  from  OvS  default  datapath
              limit.

       other_config : enable-stateless-acl-with-lb: optional string, either
       true or false
              This  option  must be set to true for stateless ACL to work with
              load balancers. When enabled, packets with the ct.inv flag  will
              not  be  dropped,  even  if use_ct_inv_match is set to true. De‚Äê
              fault: false.

       other_config : dynamic-routing-vni: optional string, containing an in‚Äê
       teger, in range 0 to 16,777,215
              This defines the vni number associated with EVPN domain that the
              Logical Switch is supposed to connect to.

              The ovn-controller expects three interfaces to exist within  the
              BGP vrf: br-$vni, lo-$vni and vxlan-$vni.

              NOTE:  this  feature  is  experimental and may be subject to re‚Äê
              moval/change in the future.

       other_config : dynamic-routing-fdb-prefer-local: optional string, ei‚Äê
       ther true or false
              This option defines the preference of FDB lookup, if set to true
              OVN will try to find the FDB entry in SB FDB table  first.  Then
              it  tries  to  resolve the FDB via ovn-controller local EVPN FDB
              cache. The option defaults to false.

              Only relevant  if  other_config:dynamic-routing-vni  is  set  to
              valid VNI.

              NOTE:  this  feature  is  experimental and may be subject to re‚Äê
              moval/change in the future.

       other_config : dynamic-routing-arp-prefer-local: optional string, ei‚Äê
       ther true or false
              This option defines the preference of ARP/ND lookup. If  set  to
              true OVN routers connected to EVPN Logical Switches on which re‚Äê
              mote  neighbor  entries  have  been  learned (Type-2 MAC+IP EVPN
              routes) will give precedence to any ARP/ND  entries  they  might
              have  in  the  SB Mac_Binding table before trying to resolve the
              MAC address via the ovn-controller local EVPN ARP/ND cache.  The
              option defaults to false.

              Only  relevant  if  other_config:dynamic-routing-vni  is  set to
              valid VNI.

              NOTE: this feature is experimental and may  be  subject  to  re‚Äê

       other_config : dynamic-routing-redistribute: optional string
              Only  relevant  if  other_config:dynamic-routing-vni  is  set to
              valid VNI.

              If fdb is specified then ovn-controller will advertise all work‚Äê
              loads that are local to the chassis. The applies to  VIFs,  con‚Äê
              tainer  ports,  virtual  ports,  connected DGPs and connected GW
              routers.

              If ip  is  specified  then  ovn-controller  will  advertise  all
              IPs/MACs bindings that are local to the chassis. This applies to
              VIFs and router ports.

              NOTE:  this  feature  is  experimental and may be subject to re‚Äê
              moval/change in the future.

              ally this is not needed because ovn-northd will assign an unique
              key for each datapath by itself. However, if it  is  configured,
              ovn-northd  honors the configured value. The typical use case is
              for interconnection: the tunnel keys for transit  switches  need
              to  be  unique  globally,  so  they are maintained in the global
              OVN_IC_Southbound database, and ovn-ic simply  syncs  the  value
              from OVN_IC_Southbound through this config.

       copp: optional weak reference to Copp
              The control plane protection policy from table Copp used for me‚Äê
              tering packets sent to ovn-controller from ports of this logical
              switch.

     Other options:

       other_config : vlan-passthru: optional string, either true or false
              Determines  whether  VLAN  tagged incoming traffic should be al‚Äê
              lowed. Note that this may have security  implications  when  en‚Äê
              abled  for  a  logical switch with a tag=0 localnet port. If not
              properly isolated from other localnet ports, fabric traffic that
              belongs to other tagged networks may be passed  through  such  a
              port.

       other_config : broadcast-arps-to-all-routers: optional string, either
       true or false
              Determines  whether arp requests and ipv6 neighbor solicitations
              should be sent to all routers and other switchports (default) or
              if it should only be sent to switchports where  the  ip/mac  ad‚Äê
              dress is unknown. Setting this to false can significantly reduce
              the  load if the logical switch can receive arp requests for ips
              it does not know about. However setting this to false also means
              that garps are no longer forwarded to all routers  and  therefor
              the mac bindings of the routers are no longer updated.

   Details:
     Core Features:

       name: string (must be unique within table)
              The logical port name.

              For  entities (VMs or containers) that are spawned in the hyper‚Äê
              visor, the name used here must match those used  in  the  exter‚Ä‚Äê
              nal_ids:iface-id in the Open_vSwitch database‚Äôs Interface table,
              because hypervisors use external_ids:iface-id as a lookup key to
              identify the network interface of that entity.

              For containers that share a VIF within a VM, the name can be any
              unique identifier. See Containers, below, for more information.

              A  logical  switch  port may not have the same name as a logical
              router port, but the database schema cannot enforce this.

       type: string
              Specify a type for this logical port. Logical ports can be  used
              to model other types of connectivity into an OVN logical switch.
              The following types are defined:

              (empty string)
                     A VM (or VIF) interface.

              router A  connection  to  a  logical  router.  The  value of op‚Ä‚Äê
                     tions:router-port  specifies  the  name  of   the   Logi‚Ä‚Äê
                     cal_Router_Port to which this logical switch port is con‚Äê
                     nected.

              switch A connection to another logical switch. The value of peer
                     specifies  the  name  of the Logical_Switch_Port to which
                     this logical switch port is connected. Such ports  always
                     have  an  implicit "unknown" address, because the address
                     information is  not  leaked  between  directly  connected
                     switches.

              localnet
                     A   connection  to  a  locally  accessible  network  from
                     ovn-controller instances that have a corresponding bridge
                     mapping. A logical  switch  can  have  multiple  localnet
                     ports attached. This type is used to model direct connec‚Äê
                     tivity  to  existing networks. In this case, each chassis
                     should have a mapping for one of  the  physical  networks
                     only.  Note:  nothing  said  above implies that a chassis
                     cannot be plugged to multiple physical networks  as  long
                     as they belong to different switches.

              localport
                     A  connection  to  a local VIF. Traffic that arrives on a
                     localport is never forwarded over  a  tunnel  to  another
                     chassis.  These  ports  are  present on every chassis and
                     have the same address in all of them.  This  is  used  to
                     model  connectivity  to  local services that run on every
                     hypervisor.

              l2gateway
                     A connection to a physical network.

              vtep   A port to a logical switch on a VTEP gateway.

              external
                     Represents a logical port which is external and not  hav‚Äê
                     ing an OVS port in the integration bridge. OVN will never
                     receive any traffic from this port or send any traffic to
                     this   port.   OVN   can  support  native  services  like
                     DHCPv4/DHCPv6/DNS for this port. If  ha_chassis_group  is
                     defined,  ovn-controller running in the active chassis of
                     the HA chassis group will bind this port to provide these
                     native services. It is expected that this port belong  to
                     a bridged logical switch (with a localnet port).

                     It  is  recommended  to use the same HA chassis group for
                     all the external ports of a  logical  switch.  Otherwise,
                     the physical switch might see MAC flap issue when differ‚Äê
                     ent chassis provide the native services. For example when
                     supporting native DHCPv4 service, DHCPv4 server mac (con‚Äê
                     figured  in  options:server_mac  column in table DHCP_Op‚Ä‚Äê
                     tions) originating from different  ports  can  cause  MAC
                     flap  issue. The MAC of the logical router IP(s) can also
                     flap if the same HA chassis group is not set for all  the
                     external ports of a logical switch.

                     Below  are some of the use cases where external ports can
                     be used.

                     ‚Ä¢      VMs connected to SR-IOV nics - Traffic from  these
                            VMs  by passes the kernel stack and local ovn-con‚Ä‚Äê
                            troller do not bind these ports and  cannot  serve
                            the native services.

                     ‚Ä¢      When CMS supports provisioning baremetal servers.

              virtual
                     Represents a logical port which does not have an OVS port
                     in the integration bridge and has a virtual ip configured
                     in  the  options:virtual-ip  column.  This virtual ip can
                     move around between the logical ports configured  in  the
                     options:virtual-parents column.

                     One of the use case where virtual ports can be used is.

                     ‚Ä¢      The  virtual ip represents a load balancer vip and
                            the virtual parents provide load balancer  service
                            in an active-standby setup with the active virtual
                            parent owning the virtual ip.

              remote A remote port is to model a port that resides remotely on
                     another OVN, which is on the other side of a transit log‚Äê
                     ical  switch  for OVN interconnection. This type of ports
                     are created by ovn-ic instead of by CMS.  Any  change  to
                     the port will be automatically overwritten by ovn-ic.

       options: map of string-string pairs
              This  column provides key/value settings specific to the logical
              port type. The type-specific options are described  individually
              below.

     Options for router ports:

       These options apply when type is router.

       options : router-port: optional string
              Required. The name of the Logical_Router_Port to which this log‚Äê
              ical switch port is connected.

       options : nat-addresses: optional string
              This  is  used  to send gratuitous ARPs for SNAT and DNAT IP ad‚Äê
              dresses via the localnet port that is attached to the same logi‚Äê
              cal switch as this type router port. This option is specified on
              a logical switch port that is connected to a gateway router,  or
              a logical switch port that is connected to a distributed gateway
              port on a logical router.

              This must take one of the following forms:

              router Gratuitous ARPs will be sent for all SNAT and DNAT exter‚Äê
                     nal  IP  addresses and for all load balancer IP addresses
                     defined on the options:router-port‚Äôs logical router,  us‚Äê
                     ing the options:router-port‚Äôs MAC address.

                     This  form  of options:nat-addresses is valid for logical
                     switch ports where options:router-port is the name  of  a
                     port  on  a  gateway router, or the name of a distributed
                     gateway port.

                     Supported only in OVN 2.8 and later. Earlier versions re‚Äê
                     quired NAT addresses to be manually synchronized.

              Ethernet address followed by one or more IPv4 addresses
                     Example:  80:fa:5b:06:72:b7  158.36.44.22   158.36.44.24.
                     This would result in generation of gratuitous ARPs for IP
                     addresses  158.36.44.22  and  158.36.44.24 with a MAC ad‚Äê
                     dress of 80:fa:5b:06:72:b7.

                     This form of options:nat-addresses is only valid for log‚Äê
                     ical switch ports where options:router-port is  the  name
                     of a port on a gateway router.

       options : exclude-lb-vips-from-garp: optional string
              If  options:nat-addresses is set to router, Gratuitous ARPs will
              be sent for all SNAT and DNAT external IP addresses  defined  on

              tions:router-port‚Äôs MAC address, not cosidering configured  load
              balancers.

       options : exclude-router-ips-from-garp: optional string
              If  options:nat-addresses is set to router, Gratuitous ARPs will
              not be sent for router port IP addresses and SNAT  IP  addresses
              (if  SNAT  IP is same as the router port IP) defined on its peer
              router port. Do not set this option if the router port  IPs  are
              also used as SNAT and DNAT IPs.

       options : arp_proxy: optional string
              Optional.  A  list  of  MAC  and  addresses/cidrs  or  just  ad‚Äê
              dresses/cidrs that this logical switch router port will reply to

              port‚Äôs  logical  router  should  have a route to forward packets
              sent to configured proxy ARP MAC/IPs to an appropriate  destina‚Äê
              tion.

       options : enable_router_port_acl: optional string, either true or false
              Optional.  Enable  conntrack  for  the router port whose peer is
              l3dgw_port if set to true. The default value is false.

       options : ct-zone-limit: optional string, containing an integer, in
       range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              CT zone limit value for given  Logical_Switch_Port.  This  value
              has priority over limit specified on Logical_Switch when config‚Äê
              ured.  The  value  0  means  unlimited.  When  the option is not
              present the limit is not set and the zone limit is derived  from
              OvS default datapath limit.

     Options for localnet ports:

       These options apply when type is localnet.

       options : network_name: optional string
              Required.  The name of the network to which the localnet port is
              connected. Each hypervisor, via ovn-controller, uses  its  local
              configuration  to  determine  exactly how to connect to this lo‚Äê
              cally accessible network, if at all.

       options : ethtype: optional string
              Optional. VLAN EtherType  field  value  for  encapsulating  VLAN
              headers. Supported values: 802.1q (default), 802.1ad.

       options : localnet_learn_fdb: optional string, either true or false
              Optional.  Allows  localnet port to learn MACs and store them in
              FDB table if set to true. The default value is false.

     Options for l2gateway ports:

       These options apply when type is l2gateway.

       options : network_name: optional string
              Required. The name of the network to which the l2gateway port is
              connected. The L2 gateway, via ovn-controller,  uses  its  local
              configuration  to  determine exactly how to connect to this net‚Äê
              work.

       options : l2gateway-chassis: optional string
              Required. The chassis on which the l2gateway logical port should
              be bound to. ovn-controller running on the defined chassis  will
              connect this logical port to the physical network.

     Options for vtep ports:

       These options apply when type is vtep.

       options : vtep-physical-switch: optional string
              Required. The name of the VTEP gateway.

       options : vtep-logical-switch: optional string
              Required. A logical switch name connected by the VTEP gateway.

     VMI (or VIF) Options:

       These options apply to logical ports with type having (empty string)

       options : requested-chassis: optional string
              If set, identifies a specific chassis (by name or hostname) that
              is  allowed  to  bind  this port. Using this option will prevent
              thrashing between two chassis trying to bind the same port  dur‚Äê
              ing  a live migration. It can also prevent similar thrashing due
              to a mis-configuration, if a port  is  accidentally  created  on
              more than one chassis.

              If set to a comma separated list, the first entry identifies the
              main  chassis  and  the  rest are one or more additional chassis
              that are allowed to bind the same port.

              When multiple chassis are set for  the  port,  and  the  logical
              switch  is  connected  to an external network through a localnet
              port, tunneling is enforced for the port to  guarantee  delivery
              of  packets  directed to the port to all its locations. This has
              MTU implications because the network  used  for  tunneling  must
              have MTU larger than localnet for stable connectivity.

              If the same host co-hosts more than one controller instance (ei‚Äê
              ther belonging to the same or separate clusters), special atten‚Äê
              tion  should be given to consistently using unique chassis names
              used in this option. It is advised that chassis names - and  not
              host names - are used for this option.

       options : activation-strategy: optional string
              If  used  with multiple chassis set in requested-chassis, speci‚Äê
              fies an activation strategy for all additional chassis.  By  de‚Äê
              fault,  no  activation strategy is used, meaning additional port
              locations are immediately available for use. The option supports
              a comma separated  list  where  you  can  combine  3  protocols,
              "rarp",  "garp"  and "na". When any of the protocols is set, the
              port is blocked for ingress and  egress  communication  until  a
              specified protocol packet is sent from a new location. The acti‚Äê
              vation  strategy  is useful in live migration scenarios for vir‚Äê
              tual machines.

       options : iface-id-ver: optional string
              If set, this port will be bound by ovn-controller only  if  this
              same  key  and value is configured in the external_ids column in
              the Open_vSwitch database‚Äôs Interface table.

       options : qos_min_rate: optional string
              If set, indicates the minimum guaranteed rate available for data
              sent from this interface, in bit/s.

       options : qos_max_rate: optional string
              If set, indicates the maximum rate for data sent from  this  in‚Äê
              terface,  in bit/s. The traffic will be shaped according to this
              limit.

       options : qos_burst: optional string
              If set, indicates the maximum burst size for data sent from this
              interface, in bits.

       options : hostname: optional string
              If set, indicates the DHCPv4 option "Hostname" (option code  12)
              associated  for  this  Logical Switch Port. If DHCPv4 is enabled
              for this Logical Switch Port, hostname dhcp option will  be  in‚Äê
              cluded in DHCP reply.

       options : force_fdb_lookup: optional string, either true or false
              This  option  is supported only if the Logical Switch Port is of
              default type (i.e. type set to empty_string) and also  addresses
              column  contains unknown. If set to true, MAC addresses (if con‚Äê
              figured) are not installed in the l2 lookup table  but  the  MAC
              addresses  are  learnt  and stored in the FDB table. The default
              value is false.

       options : disable_garp_rarp: optional string, either true or false
              If set to true, GARP and RARP announcements are not sent when  a
              VIF  port  is  created  on a bridged logical switch. The default
              value is false.

       options : pkt_clone_type: optional string, must be mc_unknown
              If set to mc_unknown, packets going to this VIF  get  cloned  to
              all unknown ports connected to the same Logical Switch.

       options : disable_arp_nd_rsp: optional string, either true or false
              If set to true, ARP/ND responder flows are not installed for the
              IP addresses configured on this logical port. Default: false.

       options : lsp_learn_mac: optional string, either true or false
              If  set  to  false, source MAC address is not learnt by FDB when
              packets are received on this port. The default value is true.

       options : receive_multicast: optional string, either true or false
              If set to false, multicast traffic  is  not  forwarded  to  this
              port. The default value is true.

       options : is-nf: optional string, either true or false
              Needs  to  be  set to true for Network Function ports. These are
              the ports used as inport or outport in  Network_Function  table.
              The default value is false.

       options : nf-linked-port: optional string
              Each  row in Network_Function table refers to two logical switch
              ports under the columns inport and outport. The port  identified
              as  inport  needs to have this option set to the port identified
              as outport, and vice-versa.

     VIF Plugging Options:

       options : vif-plug-type: optional string
              If set, OVN will attempt to perform plugging of this VIF. In or‚Äê
              der to get this port plugged by the OVN controller, OVN must  be
              built with support for VIF plugging. The default behavior is for
              the  CMS  to  do  the  VIF plugging. Each VIF plug provider have
              their own options namespaced by name, for example "vif-plug:rep‚Äê
              resentor:key". Please refer to the VIF plug provider  documenta‚Äê
              tion  located  in  Documentation/topics/vif-plug-providers/  for
              more information.

       options : vif-plug-mtu-request: optional string
              Requested MTU for plugged interfaces.  When  set  the  OVN  con‚Äê
              troller  will  fill  the  mtu_request column of the Open vSwitch
              database‚Äôs Interface table. This in turn will make OVS  vswitchd
              update the MTU of the linked interface.

     Virtual port Options:

       These options apply when type is virtual.

       options : virtual-ip: optional string
              This option represents the virtual IPv4 address.

       options : virtual-parents: optional string
              This options represents a set of logical port names (with in the
              same  logical switch) which can own the virtual ip configured in
              the options:virtual-ip. All these virtual parents should add the
              virtual ip in the port_security if port security  addressed  are
              enabled.

     IP Multicast Snooping Options:

       These options apply when the port is part of a logical switch which has
       other_config :mcast_snoop set to true.

       options : mcast_flood: optional string, either true or false
              If  set to true, multicast packets (except reports) are uncondi‚Äê
              tionally forwarded to the specific port. Default: false.

       options : mcast_flood_reports: optional string, either true or false
              If set to true, multicast reports are unconditionally  forwarded
              to the specific port. Default: false.

     Containers:

       When a large number of containers are nested within a VM, it may be too
       expensive to dedicate a VIF to each container. OVN can use VLAN tags to
       support  such  cases.  Each  container  is  assigned a VLAN ID and each
       packet that passes between the hypervisor and the VM is tagged with the
       appropriate ID for the container. Such VLAN IDs never appear on a phys‚Äê
       ical wire, even inside a tunnel, so they need not be unique except rel‚Äê
       ative to a single VM on a hypervisor.

       These columns are used for VIFs that represent nested containers  using
       shared  VIFs. For VMs and for containers that have dedicated VIFs, they
       are empty.

       parent_name: optional string
              The VM interface through which the nested  container  sends  its
              network  traffic. This must match the name column for some other
              Logical_Switch_Port. Note: for performance of the OVN Southbound
              database  conditional  monitoring,  unlike  for  regular   VIFs,
              ovn-controller will register to get updates about all OVN South‚Äê
              bound  database  Port_Binding  table  records that correspond to
              nested container ports even if  external_ids:ovn-monitor-all  is
              set to false. See ovn-controller(8) for more information.

       tag_request: optional integer, in range 0 to 4,095
              The  VLAN  tag  in  the  network  traffic associated with a con‚Äê
              tainer‚Äôs network interface. The client can request ovn-northd to
              allocate a tag that is unique within the  scope  of  a  specific
              parent  (specified  in  parent_name)  by setting a value of 0 in
              this column. The allocated value is written by ovn-northd in the
              tag column. (Note that these tags are allocated and managed  lo‚Äê
              cally  in  ovn-northd,  so  they  cannot be reconstructed in the
              event that the database is lost.) The client can also request  a
              specific non-zero tag and ovn-northd will honor it and copy that
              value to the tag column.

              When  type  is  set to localnet or l2gateway, this can be set to
              indicate that the port represents a  connection  to  a  specific
              VLAN  on  a  locally  accessible network. The VLAN ID is used to
              match incoming traffic and is also added to outgoing traffic.

       tag: optional integer, in range 1 to 4,095
              The VLAN tag allocated by ovn-northd based on  the  contents  of
              the tag_request column.

     Port State:

       up: optional boolean
              This  column  is populated by ovn-northd, rather than by the CMS
              plugin as is most of this database. When a logical port is bound
              to a physical location in the OVN  Southbound  database  Binding
              table, ovn-northd sets this column to true; otherwise, or if the
              port  becomes unbound later, it sets it to false. If this column
              is empty, the port is not considered up. This allows the CMS  to
              wait for a VM‚Äôs (or container‚Äôs) networking to become active be‚Äê
              fore it allows the VM (or container) to start.

              Logical ports of router type are an exception to this rule. They
              are  considered  to  be always up, that is this column is always
              set to true.

       enabled: optional boolean
              This column is used to administratively set port state. If  this
              column  is empty or is set to true, the port is enabled. If this
              column is set to false, the port is disabled.  A  disabled  port
              has all ingress and egress traffic dropped.

     Addressing:

       addresses: set of strings
              Addresses owned by the logical port.

              Each element in the set must take one of the following forms:

              Ethernet address followed by zero or more IPv4 or IPv6 addresses
              (or both)
                     An Ethernet address defined is owned by the logical port.
                     Like  a  physical Ethernet NIC, a logical port ordinarily
                     has a single fixed Ethernet address.

                     When a OVN logical switch processes  a  unicast  Ethernet
                     frame  whose  destination  MAC  address  is  in a logical
                     port‚Äôs addresses column, it  delivers  it  only  to  that
                     port,  as  if a MAC learning process had learned that MAC
                     address on the port.

                     If IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) (or both) are defined, it in‚Äê
                     dicates that the logical  port  owns  the  given  IP  ad‚Äê
                     dresses.

                     If  IPv4  address(es) are defined, the OVN logical switch
                     uses this information to synthesize responses to ARP  re‚Äê
                     quests  without  traversing the physical network. The OVN
                     logical router connected to the logical switch,  if  any,
                     uses  this  information to avoid issuing ARP requests for
                     logical switch ports.

                     Note that the order here is important. The  Ethernet  ad‚Äê
                     dress  must  be  listed  before the IP address(es) if de‚Äê
                     fined.

                     Examples:

                     80:fa:5b:06:72:b7
                            This indicates that  the  logical  port  owns  the
                            above mac address.

                     80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 10.0.0.4 20.0.0.4
                            This  indicates that the logical port owns the mac
                            address and two IPv4 addresses.

                     80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 fdaa:15f2:72cf:0:f816:3eff:fe20:3f41
                            This indicates that the logical port owns the  mac
                            address and 1 IPv6 address.

                     80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 10.0.0.4
                     fdaa:15f2:72cf:0:f816:3eff:fe20:3f41
                            This  indicates that the logical port owns the mac
                            address and 1 IPv4 address and 1 IPv6 address.

              unknown
                     This indicates that the logical port has an  unknown  set
                     of   Ethernet  addresses.  When  an  OVN  logical  switch
                     processes a unicast Ethernet frame whose destination  MAC
                     address is not in any logical port‚Äôs addresses column, it
                     delivers  it  to  the  port  (or  ports)  whose addresses
                     columns include unknown.

              dynamic
                     Use dynamic to make ovn-northd generate a globally unique
                     MAC address, choose an unused IPv4 address with the logi‚Äê
                     cal port‚Äôs subnet (if other_config:subnet is set  in  the
                     port‚Äôs Logical_Switch), and generate an IPv6 address from
                     the  MAC  address  (if other_config:ipv6_prefix is set in
                     the port‚Äôs Logical_Switch) and store them in  the  port‚Äôs
                     dynamic_addresses column.

                     Only  one  element  containing  dynamic may appear in ad‚Ä‚Äê
                     dresses.

              dynamic ip
              dynamic ipv6
              dynamic ip ipv6
                   These act like dynamic alone but specify particular IPv4 or
                   IPv6 addresses to use. OVN IPAM  will  still  automatically
                   allocate the other address if configured appropriately. Ex‚Äê
                   ample: dynamic 192.168.0.1 2001::1.

              mac dynamic
                   This acts like dynamic alone but specifies a particular MAC
                   address  to use. OVN IPAM will still automatically allocate
                   IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, or both,  if  configured  appropri‚Äê
                   ately. Example: 80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 dynamic

              router
                   Accepted  only when type is router. This indicates that the
                   Ethernet, IPv4, and IPv6 addresses for this logical  switch
                   port  should  be obtained from the connected logical router
                   port, as specified by router-port in options.

                   The resulting addresses are used to  populate  the  logical
                   switch‚Äôs  destination  lookup,  and  also  for  the logical
                   switch to generate ARP and ND replies.

                   If the connected logical  router  port  has  a  distributed
                   gateway  port  specified  and  the logical router has rules
                   specified in nat with external_mac,  then  those  addresses
                   are also used to populate the switch‚Äôs destination lookup.

                   Supported  only  in OVN 2.7 and later. Earlier versions re‚Äê
                   quired router addresses to be manually synchronized.

       dynamic_addresses: optional string
              Addresses assigned to the logical port by ovn-northd, if dynamic
              is specified in addresses. Addresses will be of the same  format
              as  those  that populate the addresses column. Note that dynami‚Äê
              cally assigned addresses are constructed and managed locally  in
              ovn-northd,  so  they  cannot be reconstructed in the event that
              the database is lost.

       port_security: set of strings
              This column controls the addresses from which the host  attached
              to  the  logical  port (``the host‚Äô‚Äô) is allowed to send packets
              and to which it is allowed to receive packets. If this column is
              empty, all addresses are permitted.

              Each element in the set must begin with  one  Ethernet  address.
              This would restrict the host to sending packets from and receiv‚Äê
              ing  packets  to  the  ethernet addresses defined in the logical
              port‚Äôs port_security column. It also restricts the inner  source
              MAC  addresses  that  the host may send in ARP and IPv6 Neighbor
              Discovery packets. The host is always allowed to receive packets
              to multicast and broadcast Ethernet addresses.

              Each element in the set may additionally  contain  one  or  more
              IPv4 or IPv6 addresses (or both), with optional masks. If a mask
              is  given,  it  must be a CIDR mask. In addition to the restric‚Äê
              tions described for Ethernet addresses above,  such  an  element
              restricts  the  IPv4  or  IPv6 addresses from which the host may
              send and to which it may receive packets to  the  specified  ad‚Äê
              dresses.  A  masked address, if the host part is zero, indicates
              that the host is allowed to use any address in  the  subnet;  if
              the  host part is nonzero, the mask simply indicates the size of
              the subnet. In addition:

              ‚Ä¢      If any IPv4 address is given, the host is also allowed to
                     receive packets  to  the  IPv4  local  broadcast  address
                     255.255.255.255   and   to   IPv4   multicast   addresses
                     (224.0.0.0/4). If an IPv4 address with a mask  is  given,
                     the host is also allowed to receive packets to the broad‚Äê
                     cast address in that specified subnet.

                     If  any  IPv4  address is given, the host is additionally
                     restricted to sending  ARP  packets  with  the  specified
                     source IPv4 address. (RARP is not restricted.)

              ‚Ä¢      If any IPv6 address is given, the host is also allowed to
                     receive packets to IPv6 multicast addresses (ff00::/8).

                     If  any  IPv6  address is given, the host is additionally
                     restricted to sending IPv6 Neighbor  Discovery  Solicita‚Äê
                     tion  or  Advertisement packets with the specified source
                     address or, for solicitations, the unspecified address.

              If an element includes an IPv4 address, but no  IPv6  addresses,
              then IPv6 traffic is not allowed. If an element includes an IPv6
              address,  but  no IPv4 address, then IPv4 and ARP traffic is not
              allowed.

              This column uses the same lexical syntax as the match column  in
              the OVN Southbound database‚Äôs Pipeline table. Multiple addresses
              within an element may be space or comma separated.

              This  column  is  provided  as a convenience to cloud management
              systems, but all of the features that it implements can  be  im‚Äê
              plemented as ACLs using the ACL table.

              Examples:

              80:fa:5b:06:72:b7
                     The host may send traffic from and receive traffic to the
                     specified MAC address, and to receive traffic to Ethernet
                     multicast and broadcast addresses, but not otherwise. The
                     host  may not send ARP or IPv6 Neighbor Discovery packets
                     with inner source Ethernet addresses other than  the  one
                     specified.

              80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 192.168.1.10/24
                     This  adds further restrictions to the first example. The
                     host may send IPv4 packets from or receive  IPv4  packets
                     to  only  192.168.1.10,  except  that it may also receive
                     IPv4 packets to 192.168.1.255 (based on the subnet mask),
                     255.255.255.255, and any address in 224.0.0.0/4. The host
                     may not send ARPs with a source  Ethernet  address  other
                     than  80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 or source IPv4 address other than
                     192.168.1.10. The host may not send or receive  any  IPv6
                     (including IPv6 Neighbor Discovery) traffic.

              "80:fa:5b:12:42:ba", "80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 192.168.1.10/24"
                     The host may send traffic from and receive traffic to the
                     specified MAC addresses, and to receive traffic to Ether‚Äê
                     net multicast and broadcast addresses, but not otherwise.
                     With  MAC  80:fa:5b:12:42:ba,  the  host may send traffic
                     from and receive traffic to  any  L3  address.  With  MAC
                     80:fa:5b:06:72:b7, the host may send IPv4 packets from or
                     receive IPv4 packets to only 192.168.1.10, except that it
                     may  also receive IPv4 packets to 192.168.1.255 (based on
                     the subnet mask), 255.255.255.255,  and  any  address  in
                     224.0.0.0/4.  The  host  may not send or receive any IPv6
                     (including IPv6 Neighbor Discovery) traffic.

       peer: optional string
              For a switch port used to connect  two  logical  switches,  this
              identifies the other switch port in the pair by name.

              For  a  switch port attached to a logical router, this column is
              empty.

     DHCP:

       dhcpv4_options: optional weak reference to DHCP_Options
              This column defines the DHCPv4 Options to  be  included  by  the
              ovn-controller  when  it  replies to the DHCPv4 requests. Please
              see the DHCP_Options table.

       dhcpv6_options: optional weak reference to DHCP_Options
              This column defines the DHCPv6 Options to  be  included  by  the
              ovn-controller  when  it  replies to the DHCPv6 requests. Please
              see the DHCP_Options table.

       mirror_rules: set of weak reference to Mirrors
              Mirror rules that apply to logical  switch  port  which  is  the
              source. Please see the Mirror table.

       ha_chassis_group: optional HA_Chassis_Group
              References  a  row  in  the  OVN  Northbound database‚Äôs HA_Chas‚Ä‚Äê
              sis_Group table. It indicates the HA chassis group to use if the
              type is set to external. If type is not external, this column is
              ignored.

     Naming:

       external_ids : neutron:port_name: optional string
              This column gives an optional human-friendly name for the  port.
              This  name  has no special meaning or purpose other than to pro‚Äê
              vide convenience for human interaction with the northbound data‚Äê
              base.

              Neutron copies this from its own port  object‚Äôs  name.  (Neutron
              ports do are not assigned human-friendly names by default, so it
              will often be empty.)

     Tunnel Key:

       options : requested-tnl-key: optional string, containing an integer, in
       range 1 to 32,767
              Configures  the  port  binding  tunnel key for the port. Usually
              this is not needed because ovn-northd will assign an unique  key
              for   each  port  by  itself.  However,  if  it  is  configured,
              ovn-northd honors the configured value. The typical use case  is
              for  interconnection:  the  tunnel  keys  for  ports  on transit
              switches need to be unique globally, so they are  maintained  in
              the  global  OVN_IC_Southbound database, and ovn-ic simply syncs
              the value from OVN_IC_Southbound through this config.

     Common Columns:

       external_ids: map of string-string pairs
              See External IDs at the beginning of this document.

              The ovn-northd program copies all these pairs  into  the  exter‚Ä‚Äê
              nal_ids column of the Port_Binding table in OVN_Southbound data‚Äê
              base.

Forwarding_Group TABLE
       Each row represents one forwarding group.

   Summary:
       name                          string
       vip                           string
       vmac                          string
       liveness                      boolean
       child_port                    set of 1 or more strings
       Common Columns:
         external_ids                map of string-string pairs

   Details:
       name: string
              A  name for the forwarding group. This name has no special mean‚Äê
              ing or purpose other than to provide convenience for  human  in‚Äê
              teraction with the ovn-nb database.

       vip: string
              The virtual IP address assigned to the forwarding group. It will
              respond with vmac when an ARP request is sent for vip.

       vmac: string
              The virtual MAC address assigned to the forwarding group.

       liveness: boolean
              If set to true, liveness is enabled for child ports otherwise it
              is disabled.

       child_port: set of 1 or more strings
              List of child ports in the forwarding group.

     Common Columns:

       external_ids: map of string-string pairs
              See External IDs at the beginning of this document.

Address_Set TABLE
       Each  row in this table represents a named set of addresses. An address
       set may contain Ethernet, IPv4, or IPv6 addresses with optional bitwise
       or CIDR masks. Address set may ultimately be used in  ACLs  to  compare
       against  fields  such  as ip4.src or ip6.src. A single address set must
       contain addresses of the same type. As an example, the following  would
       create an address set with three IP addresses:

             ovn-nbctl create Address_Set name=set1 addresses=‚Ä‚Äô10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2 10.0.0.3‚Ä‚Äô


       Address sets may be used in the match column of the ACL table. For syn‚Äê
       tax  information,  see  the details of the expression language used for
       the match column in the Logical_Flow table of the OVN_Southbound  data‚Äê
       base.

   Summary:
       name                          string (must be unique within table)
       addresses                     set of strings
       Common Columns:
         external_ids                map of string-string pairs

   Details:
       name: string (must be unique within table)
              A  name  for  the  address  set.  Names are ASCII and must match
              [a-zA-Z_.][a-zA-Z_.0-9]*.

       addresses: set of strings
              The set of addresses in string form.

     Common Columns:

       external_ids: map of string-string pairs
              See External IDs at the beginning of this document.

Port_Group TABLE
       Each row in this table represents  a  named  group  of  logical  switch
       ports.

       Port  groups may be used in the match column of the ACL table. For syn‚Äê
       tax information, see the details of the expression  language  used  for
       the  match column in the Logical_Flow table of the OVN_Southbound data‚Äê
       base.

       For each port group, there are two address sets generated  to  the  Ad‚Ä‚Äê
       dress_Set  table  of the OVN_Southbound database, containing the IP ad‚Äê
       dresses of the group of ports, one for IPv4, and the  other  for  IPv6,
       with  name  being  the name of the Port_Group followed by a suffix _ip4
       for IPv4 and _ip6 for IPv6. The generated address sets can be  used  in
       the same way as regular address sets in the match column of the ACL ta‚Äê
       ble. For syntax information, see the details of the expression language
       used  for  the match column in the Logical_Flow table of the OVN_South‚Ä‚Äê
       bound database.

   Summary:
       name                          string (must be unique within table)
       ports                         set   of   weak   reference   to    Logi‚Ä‚Äê

       acls                          set of ACLs
       Common Columns:
         external_ids                map of string-string pairs

   Details:
       name: string (must be unique within table)
              A  name  for  the  port  group.  Names  are ASCII and must match
              [a-zA-Z_.][a-zA-Z_.0-9]*.

       ports: set of weak reference to Logical_Switch_Ports
              The logical switch ports belonging to the group in uuids.

       acls: set of ACLs
              Access control rules that apply to the port group.  Applying  an
              ACL  to  a port group has the same effect as applying the ACL to
              all logical lswitches that the ports of the  port  group  belong
              to.

     Common Columns:

       external_ids: map of string-string pairs
              See External IDs at the beginning of this document.

Load_Balancer TABLE
       Each row represents one load balancer.

   Summary:
       name                          string
       vips                          map of string-string pairs

         options : use_stateless_nat
                                     optional string, either true or false

   Details:
       name: string
              A  name  for the load balancer. This name has no special meaning
              or purpose other than to provide convenience for human  interac‚Äê
              tion with the ovn-nb database.

       vips: map of string-string pairs
              A  map of virtual IP addresses (and an optional port number with
              : as a separator) associated with this load balancer  and  their
              corresponding  endpoint  IP addresses (and optional port numbers
              with : as separators) separated by commas. If the destination IP
              address (and port number) of a packet leaving a container  or  a
              VM  matches  the  virtual  IP address (and port number) provided
              here as a key, then OVN will statefully replace the  destination
              IP  address  by one of the provided IP address (and port number)
              in this map as a value. IPv4 and IPv6  addresses  are  supported
              for  load balancing; however a VIP of one address family may not
              be mapped to a destination IP address of a different family.  If
              specifying an IPv6 address with a port, the address portion must
              be   enclosed   in   square  brackets.  Examples  for  keys  are
              "192.168.1.4"  and  "[fd0f::1]:8800".  Examples  for  value  are
              "10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2" and "20.0.0.10:8800, 20.0.0.11:8800".

              When  the  Load_Balancer is added to the logical_switch, the VIP
              has to be in a different subnet than the one used for the  logi‚Ä‚Äê
              cal_switch.  Since VIP is in a different subnet, you should con‚Äê
              nect your logical switch to either a OVN  logical  router  or  a
              real  router  (this  is because the client can now send a packet
              with VIP as the destination IP address and router‚Äôs mac  address
              as the destination MAC address).

       protocol: optional string, one of sctp, tcp, or udp
              Valid  protocols  are  tcp,  udp, or sctp. This column is useful
              when a port number is provided as part of the  vips  column.  If
              this  column  is  empty and a port number is provided as part of
              vips column, OVN assumes the protocol to be tcp.

     Health Checks:

       OVN supports health checks for load  balancer  endpoints.  When  health
       checks are enabled, the load balancer uses only healthy endpoints.

       Suppose      that      vips      contains      a     key-value     pair
       10.0.0.10:80=10.0.0.4:8080,20.0.0.4:8080. To enable health  checks  for
       this  virtual‚Äôs endpoints, add two key-value pairs to ip_port_mappings,
       with keys 10.0.0.4 and 20.0.0.4, and add to health_check a reference to
       a Load_Balancer_Health_Check row whose vip is  set  to  10.0.0.10.  The
       same approach can be used for IPv6 as well.

       health_check: set of Load_Balancer_Health_Checks
              Load balancer health checks associated with this load balancer.

       ip_port_mappings: map of string-string pairs
              Maps  from endpoint IP to a colon-separated pair of logical port
              name and source IP, e.g.  port_name:sourc_ip  for  IPv4.  Health
              checks  are  sent to this port with the specified source IP. For
              IPv6 square brackets  must  be  used  around  IP  address,  e.g:
              port_name:[sourc_ip]  Remote endpoint: Specify :target_zone_name
              at the end of the above syntax to create remote health checks in
              a specific zone.

              For example, in the example above, IP to port mappings might  be
              defined          as         10.0.0.4=sw0-p1:10.0.0.2         and
              20.0.0.4=sw1-p1:20.0.0.2, if  the  values  given  were  suitable
              ports     and     IP    addresses.    And    remote    endpoint:
              10.0.0.4=sw0-p1:10.0.0.2:az1, where sw0-p1  -  logical  port  in
              az1.

              For   IPv6   IP   to   port   mappings   might   be  defined  as
              [2001::1]=sw0-p1:[2002::1]. Remote endpoint: same as for IP.

       selection_fields: set of strings, one of eth_dst, eth_src, ip_dst,
       ip_src, ipv6_dst, ipv6_src, tp_dst, or tp_src
              OVN native load  balancers  are  supported  using  the  OpenFlow
              groups  of  type  select.  OVS  supports  two selection methods:
              dp_hash and hash (with optional fields specified)  in  selecting
              the  buckets  of  a group. Please see the OVS documentation (man
              ovs-ofctl) for more details on the selection methods. Each  end‚Äê
              point  IP  (and  port if set) is mapped to a bucket in the group
              flow.

              CMS can choose the hash selection method by setting  the  selec‚Äê
              tion  fields  in  this  column.  ovs-vswitchd uses the specified
              fields in generating the hash.

              Example: {ip_proto,ip_src,ip_dst} for a 3-tuple match.  Example:
              {ip_proto,ipv6_src,ipv6_dst}   for   an   IPv6  match.  Example:
              {ip_proto,ip_src,ip_dst,tp_src,tp_dst}.                 Example:
              {ip_src,ip_dst,ipv6_src,ipv6_dst,tp_src,tp_dst}.

              dp_hash selection method uses the assistance of datapath to cal‚Äê
              culate the hash and it is expected to be faster than hash selec‚Äê
              tion  method.  So CMS should take this into consideration before
              using the hash method. Please consult the OVS documentation  and
              OVS sources for the implementation details.

     Common Columns:

       external_ids: map of string-string pairs
              See External IDs at the beginning of this document.

     Load_Balancer options:

       options : reject: optional string, either true or false
              If  the load balancer is created with --reject option and it has
              no active backends, a TCP reset segment (for  tcp)  or  an  ICMP
              port  unreachable packet (for all other kind of traffic) will be
              sent whenever an incoming packet is received for this  load-bal‚Äê
              ancer.  Please  note using --reject option will disable empty_lb
              SB controller event for this load balancer.

       options : hairpin_snat_ip: optional string
              IP to be used as source IP for  packets  that  have  been  hair-
              pinned  after  load balancing. The default behavior when the op‚Äê
              tion is not set is to use the load balancer VIP  as  source  IP.
              This option may have exactly one IPv4 and/or one IPv6 address on
              it, separated by a space character.

       options : skip_snat: optional string
              If  the load balancing rule is configured with skip_snat option,
              the option lb_force_snat_ip configured for  the  logical  router
              that  references this load balancer will not be applied for this
              load balancer.

       options : add_route: optional string
              If set to true, then neighbor routers will  have  logical  flows
              added  that  will  allow for routing to the VIP IP. It also will
              have ARP resolution logical flows added. By setting this option,
              it means there is no  reason  to  create  a  Logical_Router_Sta‚Ä‚Äê
              tic_Route  from  neighbor  routers  to this NAT address. It also
              means that no ARP request is required for  neighbor  routers  to
              learn  the  IP-MAC mapping for this VIP IP. For more information
              about what flows  are  added  for  IP  routes,  please  see  the
              ovn-northd manpage section on IP Routing.

       options : neighbor_responder: optional string
              If  set  to  all, then routers on which the load balancer is ap‚Äê
              plied reply to ARP/neighbor discovery requests for all  VIPs  of
              the  load  balancer.  If set to reachable, then routers on which
              the load balancer is applied reply to ARP/neighbor discovery re‚Äê
              quests only for VIPs that are part of a router‚Äôs subnet. If  set
              to  none,  then  routers  on  which the load balancer is applied
              never reply to ARP/neighbor discovery requests for  any  of  the
              load balancer VIPs. Load balancers with options:template=true do
              not support reachable as a valid mode. The default value of this
              option,  if  not  specified,  is reachable for regular load bal‚Äê
              ancers and none for template load balancers.

       options : template: optional string
              Option to be set to true, if the load balancer  is  a  template.
              The  load  balancer VIPs and backends must be using Chassis_Tem‚Ä‚Äê
              plate_Var in their definitions.

              Load balancer template VIP supported formats are:

              ^VIP_VAR[:^PORT_VAR|:port]


              where VIP_VAR and PORT_VAR are keys of the  Chassis_Template_Var
              variables records.

              Note: The VIP and PORT cannot be combined into a single template
              variable. For example, a Chassis_Template_Var variable expanding
              to 10.0.0.1:8080 is not valid if used as VIP.

              Load balancer template backend supported formats are:

              ^BACKEND_VAR1[:^PORT_VAR1|:port],^BACKEND_VAR2[:^PORT_VAR2|:port]
              or
              ^BACKENDS_VAR1,^BACKENDS_VAR2


              where  BACKEND_VAR1,  PORT_VAR1,  BACKEND_VAR2, PORT_VAR2, BACK‚Ä‚Äê
              ENDS_VAR1 and BACKENDS_VAR2 are keys of the Chassis_Template_Var
              variables records.

              In the above examples, square brackets are only used to indicate
              choosing between the enclosed options. But when adding to  Chas‚Ä‚Äê
              sis_Template_Var  variables  backend  IPv6 addresses must be en‚Äê
              closed in []. VIPs must not be enclosed in []. For example:  lb‚Ä‚Äê
              vip="3001::10",lbport=12010,lbback="[2001::1]",
              ip6_back="[2001::1]:12010"

       options : address-family: optional string
              Address  family  used by the load balancer. Supported values are
              ipv4 and ipv6. The address-family is only  used  for  load  bal‚Äê
              ancers  with options:template=true. For explicit load balancers,
              setting the address-family has no effect.

       options : affinity_timeout: optional string
              If the CMS provides a positive value  (in  seconds)  for  affin‚Ä‚Äê
              ity_timeout,  OVN  will  dnat connections received from the same
              client to this lb to the same backend if received in the  affin‚Äê
              ity timeslot. Max supported affinity_timeout is 65535 seconds.

       options : ct_flush: optional string, either true or false
              The  value  indicates whether ovn-controller should flush CT en‚Äê
              tries that are related to this LB. The flush happens if  the  LB
              is  removed, any of the backends is updated/removed or the LB is
              not considered local anymore by the ovn-controller. This  option
              is set to false by default.

       options : use_stateless_nat: optional string, either true or false
              If the load balancer is configured with use_stateless_nat option
              to  true,  the logical router that references this load balancer
              will use Stateless NAT rules when the logical router has  multi‚Äê
              ple  distributed  gateway  ports(DGP).  Otherwise,  the outbound
              traffic may be dropped in  scenarios  where  we  have  different
              chassis for each DGP. This option is set to false by default.

Load_Balancer_Group TABLE
       Each  row  represents a logical grouping of load balancers. It is up to
       the CMS to decide the criteria on which load balancers are grouped  to‚Äê
       gether.  To  simplify configuration and to optimize its processing load
       balancers that must be associated to the same set of  logical  switches
       and/or logical routers should be grouped together.

   Summary:
       name                          string (must be unique within table)
       load_balancer                 set of weak reference to Load_Balancers

   Details:
       name: string (must be unique within table)
              A  name  for  the  load balancer group. This name has no special
              meaning or purpose other than to provide convenience  for  human
              interaction with the ovn-nb database.

       load_balancer: set of weak reference to Load_Balancers
              A set of load balancers.

Load_Balancer_Health_Check TABLE
       Each row represents one load balancer health check.

   Summary:
       vip                           string
       Health check options:
         options : interval          optional string, containing an integer
         options : timeout           optional string, containing an integer
         options : success_count     optional string, containing an integer
         options : failure_count     optional string, containing an integer
       Common Columns:

   Details:
       vip: string
              vip whose endpoints should be monitored for health check.

     Health check options:

       options : interval: optional string, containing an integer
              The interval, in seconds, between health checks.

       options : timeout: optional string, containing an integer
              The time, in seconds, after which a health check times out.

       options : success_count: optional string, containing an integer
              The number of successful checks after which the endpoint is con‚Äê
              sidered online.

       options : failure_count: optional string, containing an integer
              The number of failure checks after which the endpoint is consid‚Äê
              ered offline.

     Common Columns:

       external_ids: map of string-string pairs
              See External IDs at the beginning of this document.

ACL TABLE
       Each  row in this table represents one ACL rule for a logical switch or
       a port group that points to it through its acls column. The action col‚Äê
       umn for the highest-priority matching row in this  table  determines  a
       packet‚Äôs  treatment. If no row matches, packets are allowed by default.
       (Default-deny treatment is possible: add a rule with priority 0,  1  as
       match, and deny as action.)

   Summary:
       label                         integer, in range 0 to 4,294,967,295
       priority                      integer, in range 0 to 32,767

       Logging:
         log                         boolean
         name                        optional  string,  at  most 63 characters
                                     long
         severity                    optional string,  one  of  alert,  debug,

         meter                       optional string
       sample_new                    optional Sample
       sample_est                    optional Sample
       Common Columns:
         options                     map of string-string pairs
         ACL configuration options:
            options : log-related    optional string
         external_ids                map of string-string pairs

   Details:
       label: integer, in range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              Associates  an  identifier  with the ACL. The same value will be
              written to corresponding connection  tracker  entry.  The  value
              should  be  a valid 32-bit unsigned integer. This value can help
              in debugging from connection tracker side. For example,  through
              this "label" we can backtrack to the ACL rule which is causing a
              "leaked" connection. Connection tracker entries are created only
              for allowed connections so the label is valid only for allow and
              allow-related actions.

              Note: if an ACL has both sampling enabled and a label associated
              to  it  then  the label value overrides the observation point ID
              defined in the sample_new or sample_est configuration.

       priority: integer, in range 0 to 32,767
              The ACL rule‚Äôs priority. Rules with numerically higher  priority
              take precedence over those with lower. If two ACL rules with the
              same  priority  both  match,  then the one actually applied to a
              packet is undefined.

              Return traffic from an allow-related flow is always allowed  and
              cannot be changed through an ACL.

              allow-stateless  flows  always  take  precedence before stateful
              ACLs, regardless of their priority. (Both  allow  and  allow-re‚Ä‚Äê
              lated ACLs can be stateful.)

       direction: string, either from-lport or to-lport
              Direction of the traffic to which this rule should apply:

              ‚Ä¢      from-lport: Used to implement filters on traffic arriving
                     from a logical port. These rules are applied to the logi‚Äê
                     cal switch‚Äôs ingress pipeline.

              ‚Ä¢      to-lport:  Used to implement filters on traffic forwarded
                     to a logical port. These rules are applied to the logical
                     switch‚Äôs egress pipeline.

       match: string
              The packets that the ACL should match, in  the  same  expression
              language  used  for the match column in the OVN Southbound data‚Äê
              base‚Äôs Logical_Flow table. The  outport  logical  port  is  only
              available  in the to-lport direction (the inport is available in
              both directions).

              By default all traffic is allowed. When writing a more  restric‚Äê
              tive  policy, it is important to remember to allow flows such as
              ARP and IPv6 neighbor discovery packets.

              Note that you can not create an ACL  matching  on  a  port  with
              type=router or type=localnet.

       action: string, one of allow-related, allow-stateless, allow, drop,
       pass, or reject
              The action to take when the ACL rule matches:

              ‚Ä¢      allow-stateless:  Always  forward the packet in stateless
                     manner, omitting connection tracking  mechanism,  regard‚Äê
                     less  of  other rules defined for the switch. May require
                     defining additional rules for inbound replies. For  exam‚Äê
                     ple,  if  you define a rule to allow outgoing TCP traffic
                     directed to an IP address, then you probably also want to
                     define another rule to allow incoming TCP traffic  coming
                     from  this  same  IP  address.  In addition, traffic that
                     matches stateless ACLs will bypass load-balancer DNAT/un-
                     DNAT processing. Stateful ACLs should be used instead  if
                     the traffic is supposed to be load-balanced.

              ‚Ä¢      allow:  Forward the packet. It will also send the packets
                     through connection tracking when allow-related rules  ex‚Äê
                     ist  on the logical switch. Otherwise, it‚Äôs equivalent to
                     allow-stateless.

              ‚Ä¢      allow-related: Forward the  packet  and  related  traffic
                     (e.g. inbound replies to an outbound connection).

              ‚Ä¢      drop: Silently drop the packet.

              ‚Ä¢      reject:  Drop  the packet, replying with a RST for TCP or
                     ICMPv4/ICMPv6    unreachable    message     for     other
                     IPv4/IPv6-based protocols.

              ‚Ä¢      pass:  Pass  to  the next ACL tier. If using multiple ACL
                     tiers, a match on this ACL will stop evaluating  ACLs  at
                     the  current  tier and move to the next one. If not using
                     ACL tiers or if a pass ACL is matched at the final  tier,
                     then   the   options:default_acl_drop   option  from  the
                     NB_Global table is used to determine how to proceed.

       tier: integer, in range 0 to 3
              The hierarchical tier that this ACL belongs to.

              ACLs can be assigned to numerical tiers. When  evaluating  ACLs,
              an  internal  counter  is  used  to determine which tier of ACLs
              should be evaluated. Tier 0 ACLs are evaluated first. If no ver‚Äê
              dict can be determined, then tier 1  ACLs  are  evaluated  next.
              This  continues  until the maximum tier value is reached. If all
              tiers of ACLs are evaluated and no verdict is reached, then  the
              options:default_acl_drop  option from table NB_Global is used to
              determine how to proceed.

              In this version of OVN, the maximum tier value for  ACLs  is  3,
              meaning there are 4 tiers of ACLs allowed (0-3).

       network_function_group: optional Network_Function_Group
              Group  of  network  functions to which the traffic matching this
              ACL is redirected.

     options:

       ACLs options.

       options : apply-after-lb: optional string
              If set to true, the ACL will be  applied  after  load  balancing
              stage. Supported only for from-lport direction.

              The  main use case of this option is to support ACLs matching on
              the destination IP address of the packet for the backend IPs  of
              load balancers.

              OVN  will  apply the from-lport ACLs in two stages. ACLs without
              this option apply-after-lb set, will be applied before the  load
              balancer stage and ACLs with this option set will be applied af‚Äê
              ter  the  load balancer stage. The priorities are indepedent be‚Äê
              tween these stages and may not be obvious to the CMS. Hence  CMS
              should  be extra careful when using this option and should care‚Äê
              fully evaluate the priorities of all the ACLs  and  the  default
              deny/allow ACLs if any.

       options : persist-established: optional string
              This  option  applies  only  to  ACLs whose action is set to al‚Ä‚Äê
              low-related.

              allow-related ACLs  create  a  conntrack  entry  when  a  packet
              matches the ACL‚Äôs match column. Typically, traffic must continue
              to  match these conditions in order to continue to be allowed by
              the ACL. With this option set to true, then the ACL match is by‚Äê
              passed once the original match occurs. Instead, a  mark  bit  in
              the  conntrack  entry  is  used to allow the traffic. This means
              that traffic will continue to be allowed even if the ACL‚Äôs match
              changes and no longer matches the established traffic.

              The traffic will stop being allowed automatically if this option
              is set to false, if the ACL‚Äôs action  is  changed  to  something
              other than allow-related, or if the ACL is destroyed.

     Logging:

       These  columns  control  whether and how OVN logs packets that match an
       ACL.

       log: boolean
              If set to true, packets that match the ACL will  trigger  a  log
              message on the transport node or nodes that perform ACL process‚Äê
              ing. Logging may be combined with any action.

              If  set  to  false,  the remaining columns in this group have no
              significance.

       name: optional string, at most 63 characters long
              This name, if it is provided, is included  in  log  records.  It
              provides the administrator and the cloud management system a way
              to associate a log record with a particular ACL.

       severity: optional string, one of alert, debug, info, notice, or warn‚Ä‚Äê
       ing
              The severity of the ACL. The severity levels match those of sys‚Äê
              log,  in  decreasing  level of severity: alert, warning, notice,
              info, or debug. When the column is empty, the default is info.

       meter: optional string
              The name of a meter to rate-limit log messages for the ACL.  The
              string  must  match the name column of a row in the Meter table.
              By default, log messages are not rate-limited. In order  to  en‚Äê
              sure  that  the  same  Meter rate limits multiple ACL logs sepa‚Äê
              rately, set the fair column.

       sample_new: optional Sample
              The entry in the Sample table to use for sampling for  new  ses‚Äê
              sions  matched by this ACL. In case the ACL is stateless this is
              used for sampling all traffic matched by the ACL.

              Note: if an ACL has both sampling enabled and a label associated
              to it then the label value overrides the  observation  point  ID
              defined in the sample_new configuration.

       sample_est: optional Sample
              The  entry  in  the  Sample table to use for sampling for estab‚Äê
              lished/related sessions matched by this ACL.

              Note: if an ACL has both sampling enabled and a label associated
              to it then the label value overrides the  observation  point  ID
              defined in the sample_est configuration.

     Common Columns:

       options: map of string-string pairs
              This  column  provides general key/value settings. The supported
              options are described individually below.

     ACL configuration options:

       options : log-related: optional string
              If set to true, then log when reply or related traffic is admit‚Äê
              ted from a stateful ACL. In order for this option  to  function,
              the  log option must be set to true and a label must be set, and
              it must be unique to the ACL. The label is necessary  as  it  is
              the  only  means  to associate the reply traffic with the ACL to
              which it belongs. It must be unique, because otherwise it is am‚Äê
              biguous which ACL will be matched. Note: If this option  is  en‚Äê
              abled,  an  extra  flow is installed in order to log the related
              traffic. Therefore, if this is enabled on all ACLs, then the to‚Äê
              tal number of flows necessary to log the ACL traffic is doubled,
              compared to if this option is not enabled.

       Common Columns:
         external_ids                map of string-string pairs
       Transit router:

   Details:
       ports: set of Logical_Router_Ports
              The router‚Äôs ports.

       static_routes: set of Logical_Router_Static_Routes
              Zero or more static routes for the router.

       policies: set of Logical_Router_Policys
              Zero or more routing policies for the router.

       enabled: optional boolean
              This column is used to administratively  set  router  state.  If
              this  column  is empty or is set to true, the router is enabled.
              If this column is set to false, the router is disabled.  A  dis‚Äê
              abled router has all ingress and egress traffic dropped.

       nat: set of NATs
              One  or  more  NAT  rules for the router. NAT rules only work on
              Gateway routers, and on distributed routers with  one  and  only
              one distributed gateway port.

       load_balancer: set of weak reference to Load_Balancers
              Set  of  load  balancers associated to this logical router. Load
              balancer rules only work  without  limitations  on  the  Gateway
              routers  or  routers  with  one and only one distributed gateway
              port (DGP). Load balancers will only work in scenarios that  use
              more than one DGP when the multiple DGPs are associated with the
              same  gateway  chassis, this way this chassis can apply/maintain
              the conntrack state without problems. To use a load balancer  in
              scenarios  with  DGPs  associated with different gateway chassis
              (e.g. ECMP routes), consider using the use_stateless_nat  option
              to true in the load balancer options column.

       load_balancer_group: set of Load_Balancer_Groups
              Set of load balancers groups associated to this logical router.

     Naming:

       These columns provide names for the logical router. From OVN‚Äôs perspec‚Äê
       tive, these names have no special meaning or purpose other than to pro‚Äê
       vide  convenience  for  human interaction with the northbound database.
       There is no requirement for the name to be unique. (For a unique  iden‚Äê
       tifier for a logical router, use its row UUID.)

       (Originally, name was intended to serve the purpose of a human-friendly
       name,  but the Neutron integration used it to uniquely identify its own
       router object, in the format neutron-uuid. Later  on,  Neutron  started
       propagating   the  friendly  name  of  a  router  as  external_ids:neu‚Ä‚Äê
       tron:router_name. Perhaps this can be cleaned up someday.)

       name: string
              A name for the logical router.

       external_ids : neutron:router_name: optional string
              Another name for the logical router.

       copp: optional weak reference to Copp
              The control plane protection policy from table Copp used for me‚Äê
              tering packets sent to ovn-controller from logical ports of this
              router.

     Options:

       Additional options for the logical router.

       options : chassis: optional string
              If set, indicates that the logical router in question is a Gate‚Äê
              way router (which is centralized) and resides in the  set  chas‚Äê
              sis.  The  same value is also used by ovn-controller to uniquely
              identify the chassis in the OVN deployment and comes from exter‚Ä‚Äê
              nal_ids:system-id in  the  Open_vSwitch  table  of  Open_vSwitch
              database.

              The Gateway router can only be connected to a distributed router
              via  a switch if SNAT and DNAT are to be configured in the Gate‚Äê
              way router.

       options : dnat_force_snat_ip: optional string
              If set, indicates a set of IP addresses to use to force  SNAT  a
              packet  that has already been DNATed in the gateway router. When
              multiple gateway routers are configured,  a  packet  can  poten‚Äê
              tially  enter any of the gateway router, get DNATted and eventu‚Äê
              ally reach the logical switch port. For the return traffic to go
              back to the same gateway  router  (for  unDNATing),  the  packet
              needs a SNAT in the first place. This can be achieved by setting
              the  above  option  with a gateway specific set of IP addresses.
              This option may have exactly one IPv4 and/or one IPv6 address on
              it, separated by a a space.

       options : lb_force_snat_ip: optional string
              If set, this option can take two possible type of values. Either
              a set of IP addresses or the string value - router_ip.

              If a set of IP addresses are configured, it indicates to use  to
              force  SNAT  a packet that has already been load-balanced in the
              gateway router. When multiple gateway routers are configured,  a
              packet  can  potentially  enter  any of the gateway routers, get
              DNATted as part of the load-balancing and eventually  reach  the
              logical  switch  port.  For the return traffic to go back to the
              same gateway router (for unDNATing), the packet needs a SNAT  in
              the  first  place. This can be achieved by setting the above op‚Äê
              tion with a gateway specific set of IP  addresses.  This  option
              may  have  exactly one IPv4 and/or one IPv6 address on it, sepa‚Äê
              rated by a space character.

              If it is configured with the value router_ip, then the load bal‚Äê
              anced packet is SNATed with the IP of router port  (attached  to
              the gateway router) selected as the destination after taking the
              routing decision.

       options : mcast_relay: optional string, either true or false
              Enables/disables  IP  multicast  relay  between logical switches
              connected to the logical router. Default: False.

       options : dynamic_neigh_routers: optional string, either true or false
              If set to true, the router will resolve  neighbor  routers‚Äô  MAC
              addresses  only by dynamic ARP/ND, instead of prepopulating sta‚Äê
              tic mappings for all neighbor routers in the  ARP/ND  Resolution
              stage.  This  reduces  number of flows, but requires ARP/ND mes‚Äê
              sages to resolve the IP-MAC bindings when needed. It is false by
              default. It is recommended to set to true when a large number of
              logical routers are connected to the  same  logical  switch  but
              most  of  them never need to send traffic between each other. By
              default, ovn-northd does not create mappings  to  NAT  and  load
              balancer addresess. However, for NAT and load balancer addresses
              that  have  the  add_route  option added, ovn-northd will create
              logical flows that map NAT and load balancer IP addresses to the
              appropriate MAC address. Setting dynamic_neigh_routers  to  true
              will prevent the automatic creation of these logical flows.

       options : always_learn_from_arp_request: optional string, either true
       or false
              This  option  controls  the  behavior when handling IPv4 ARP re‚Äê
              quests or IPv6 ND-NS packets - whether a dynamic  neighbor  (MAC
              binding) entry is added/updated.

              true  -  Always learn the MAC-IP binding, and add/update the MAC
              binding entry.

              false - If there is a MAC binding for that IP  and  the  MAC  is
              different,  or, if TPA of ARP request belongs to any router port
              on this router, then update/add that MAC-IP binding.  Otherwise,
              don‚Äôt update/add entries.

              It  is true by default. It is recommended to set to false when a
              large number of logical routers are connected to the same  logi‚Äê
              cal  switch  but most of them never need to send traffic between
              each other, to reduce the size of the MAC binding table.

       options : requested-tnl-key: optional string, containing an integer, in
       range 1 to 16,777,215
              Configures the datapath tunnel key for the logical router.  This
              is  not  needed because ovn-northd will assign an unique key for
              each  datapath  by  itself.  However,  if  it   is   configured,
              ovn-northd honors the configured value.

       options : snat-ct-zone: optional string, containing an integer, in
       range 0 to 65,535
              Use the requested conntrack zone for SNAT with this router. This
              can  be useful if egress traffic from the host running OVN comes
              from both OVN and other sources. This way,  OVN  and  the  other
              sources can make use of the same conntrack zone.

       options : mac_binding_age_threshold: optional string
              Specifies  the MAC binding aging thresholds based on CIDRs, with
              the format: entry[;entry[...]], where each entry has the format:
              [cidr:]threshold

              ‚Ä¢      cidr: Can be either an IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR.

              ‚Ä¢      threshold: Threshold value in seconds. MAC bindings  with
                     IP addresses matching the specified CIDR that exceed this
                     timeout will be automatically removed.

              If  an  entry  is  provided  without an CIDR (just the threshold
              value), it specifies the default threshold for MAC bindings that
              don‚Äôt match any of the given CIDRs. If there  are  multiple  de‚Äê
              fault  threshold  entries  in  the option, the behavior is unde‚Äê
              fined.

              If there are multiple CIDRs matching a MAC binding IP,  the  one
              with the longest prefix length takes effect. If there are multi‚Äê
              ple  entries  with  the same CIDR in the option, the behavior is
              undefined.

              If no matching CIDR is found for a MAC binding IP,  and  no  de‚Äê
              fault threshold is specified, the behavior defaults to the orig‚Äê
              inal: the binding will not be removed based on age.

              The  value can also default to an empty string, which means that
              the aging threshold is disabled. Any string  not  in  the  above
              format is regarded as invalid and the aging is disabled.

              Example: 192.168.0.0/16:300;192.168.10.0/24:0;fe80::/10:600;1200

              This  sets  a  threshold of 300 seconds for MAC bindings with IP
              addresses   in   the   192.168.0.0/16   range,   excluding   the
              192.168.1.0/24  range  (for  which  the  aging  is  disabled), a
              threshold of 600 seconds for MAC bindings with IP  addresses  in
              the  fe80::/10  IPv6 range, and a default threshold of 1200 sec‚Äê
              onds for all other MAC bindings.

       options : ct-zone-limit: optional string, containing an integer, in
       range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              CT zone limit value for given Logical_Router. The value 0  means
              unlimited.  When  the option is not present the limit is not set
              and the zone limit is derived from OvS default datapath limit.

       options : dynamic-routing: optional string, either true or false
              If set to true then this Logical_Router can participate  in  dy‚Äê
              namic  routing  with components outside of OVN. It will synchro‚Äê
              nize all routes to the soutbound Advertised_Route table that are
              relevant for the router. This includes:

              ‚Ä¢      all "connected" routes implicitly created by networks as‚Äê
                     sociated with this Logical Router

              ‚Ä¢      all Logical_Router_Static_Route that are applied to  this
                     Logical Router
       Users  will  need  to use the following settings to opt into individual
       route types that should be advertised. See:

              ‚Ä¢      options:dynamic-routing-redistribute on Logical_Router

              ‚Ä¢      options:dynamic-routing-redistribute       on       Logi‚Äê
                     cal_Router_Port

       options : dynamic-routing-redistribute: optional string
              Only relevant if options:dynamic-routing is set to true.

              This is a list of elements separated by ,.

              If  connected  is  in  the list then northd will synchronize all
              "connected" routes to  the  southbound  Advertised_Route  table.
              "Connected" here means routes implicitly created by networks as‚Äê
              sociated with the LRPs.

              If  connected-as-host  is in the list then northd will enumerate
              all actively used individual IPs of a "connected" route and  an‚Äê
              nounce  these  IPs as host routes instead of announcing the sub‚Äê
              net. This includes LSP and LRP addresses on the network as  well
              as  NAT  entries of remove Logical_Routers on this network. Set‚Äê
              ting this implies the setting connected.  This  setting  can  be
              used to:

              ‚Ä¢      allow  the  fabric outside of OVN to drop traffic towards
                     IP addresses that are not  actually  used.  This  traffic
                     would otherwise hit this LR and then be dropped.

              ‚Ä¢      If  this  LR has multiple LRPs connected to the fabric on
                     different chassis: allows the fabric outside  of  OVN  to
                     steer  packets  to  the  chassis which already hosts this
                     backing ip address.

              If static is in the list then northd will synchronize all  Logi‚Ä‚Äê
              cal_Router_Static_Route  to  the southbound Advertised_Route ta‚Äê
              ble.

              If lb is in the list then northd will create entries  in  Adver‚Ä‚Äê
              tised_Route  table for each Load Balancer VIP on this router and
              it‚Äôs neighboring routers. Neighboring routers are those that are
              either directly connected, via Logical  Router  Port,  or  those
              that are connected via shared Logical Switch.

              If  nat is in the list then northd will create entries in Adver‚Ä‚Äê
              tised_Route table for each NAT‚Äôs external IP on this router  and
              it‚Äôs neighboring routers. Neighboring routers are those that are
              either  directly  connected,  via  Logical Router Port, or those
              that are connected via shared Logical Switch.

              This value can be overwritten on  a  per  LRP  basis  using  op‚Ä‚Äê
              tions:dynamic-routing-redistribute on the Logical_Router_Port.

       options : dynamic-routing-redistribute-local-only: optional string, ei‚Äê
       ther true or false
              Only relevant if options:dynamic-routing is set to true.

              This  controls  whether  ovn-controller  will  advertise  Adver‚Ä‚Äê
              tised_Route records only on the chassis where their tracked_port
              is bound. Default: false.

       options : dynamic-routing-vrf-name: optional string
              Only relevant if options:dynamic-routing is set to true.

              This defines the name of the vrf the ovn-controller will use  to
              advertise  and  learn  routes.  If not set the vrf will be named
              "ovnvrf" with the options:dynamic-routing-vrf-id or datapath  id
              of the Logical Router appended to it.

              The  vrf name must be a valid linux interface name. If it is too
              long the generated name will be used instead.

              The vrf table id is not affected by this  setting.  For  details
              see options:dynamic-routing-maintain-vrf on the Logical_Router.

       options : dynamic-routing-vrf-id: optional string, containing an inte‚Äê
       ger, in range 1 to 4,294,967,295
              Only relevant if options:dynamic-routing is set to true.

              This  defines  the  vrf table id used by the specified vrf. When
              not set or set to invalid  value  datapath  id  of  the  Logical
              Router will be used instead.

              This  can  also affect the vrf name. For details see options:dy‚Ä‚Äê
              namic-routing-vrf-name on the Logical_Router.

       options : dynamic-routing-no-learning: optional string, either true or
       false
              Only relevant if options:dynamic-routing is set to true.

              This option disables route learning on  a  specific  router  and
              will also remove learned routes.

       options : dynamic-routing-v4-prefix-nexthop: optional string
              Only relevant if options:dynamic-routing is set to true.

              This  defines  nexthop used by IPv4 advertised routes instead of
              the routes being advertised as blackhole.  This  can  be  either
              valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.

       options : dynamic-routing-v6-prefix-nexthop: optional string
              Only relevant if options:dynamic-routing is set to true.

              This  defines  nexthop used by IPv6 advertised routes instead of
              the routes being advertised as blackhole. This can be only valid
              IPv6 address.

       options : ct-commit-all: optional string, either true or false
              When enabled the LR will commit traffic in a zone that is state‚Äê
              ful. The traffic is not commited to both zones but it is  selec‚Äê
              tive based whether there is stateful DNAT/SNAT or both. The com‚Äê
              mit  all will prevent issues with ct.inv packets as it will pre‚Äê
              vent the commit of reply traffic, which  could  happen  in  some
              cases. This also helps with HWOL as there shouldn‚Äôt be any match
              on  ct.new for established sessions as we will commit everything
              in addition to already existing stateful NATs and LBs.

       options : ic-route-filter-adv: optional string
              This option expects  list  of  CIDRs  delimited  by  ","  that‚Äôs
              present in the Logical Router. A route will be advertised if the
              route‚Äôs  prefix  belongs to any of the CIDRs listed. This allows
              to filter CIDR prefixes in the process of advertising routes  in
              ovn-ic daemon.

       options : ic-route-filter-learn: optional string
              This  option  expects  list  of  CIDRs  delimited  by "," that‚Äôs
              present in the Logical Router. A route will be  learned  if  the
              route‚Äôs  prefix  belongs to any of the CIDRs listed. This allows
              to filter CIDR prefixes in the process  of  learning  routes  in
              ovn-ic daemon.

       options : ic-route-deny-adv: optional string
              This  option  expects  list  of  CIDRs  delimited  by "," that‚Äôs
              present in the Logical Router. A route will not be advertised if
              the route‚Äôs prefix belongs to any of the CIDRs listed. This  al‚Äê
              lows  to  filter  CIDR  prefixes  in  the process of advertising
              routes in ovn-ic daemon.

       options : ic-route-deny-learn: optional string
              This option expects  list  of  CIDRs  delimited  by  ","  that‚Äôs
              present  in  the  Logical Router. A route will not be learned if
              the route‚Äôs prefix belongs to any of the CIDRs listed. This  al‚Äê
              lows  to  filter CIDR prefixes in the process of learning routes
              in ovn-ic daemon.

       options : disable_garp_rarp: optional string, either true or false
              If set to true, GARP and RARP announcements are not sent by  all
              the  VIF peer ports of this logical router. The default value is
              false.

     Common Columns:

       external_ids: map of string-string pairs
              See External IDs at the beginning of this document.

     Transit router:

       In order to achieve status of Transit Router for  Logical_Router  there
       needs to be at least one Logical_Router_Port that is considered remote.
       The  LRP  can be remote only if it has options:requested-chassis set to
       chassis that is considered remote. See Logical_Router_Port for more de‚Äê
       tails.

       In order for the Transit Router to work properly all  the  tunnel  keys
       for the Transit Router itself and its router ports need to match in all
       AZs  e.g.  TR  in  AZ1 and AZ2 need to have the same tunnel key. Remote
       ports for AZ2 in AZ1 need to have the same tunnel key as local ports in
       AZ2 and vice versa. It‚Äôs also possible that the router has  non-transit
       ports,  without  options:requested-chassis set; their keys also need to
       match in all AZs.

       The Transit Router behaves as distributed router which  means  that  it
       has  the  same  limitations  for stateful flows like NAT and LBs and it
       will lose the CT state between AZs.

QoS TABLE
       Each row in this table represents one QoS rule  for  a  logical  switch
       that  points  to  it through its qos_rules column. Two types of QoS are
       supported: DSCP marking and metering. A match with the highest-priority
       will have QoS applied to it. If the action column  is  specified,  then
       matching  packets will have DSCP marking applied. If the bandwidth col‚Äê
       umn is specified, then matching packets will have metering applied. ac‚Ä‚Äê
       tion and bandwidth are not exclusive, so both marking and  metering  by
       defined  for  the  same  QoS entry. If no row matches, packets will not
       have any QoS applied.

   Summary:
       priority                      integer, in range 0 to 32,767
       direction                     string, either from-lport or to-lport
       match                         string
       action                        map of string-integer pairs,  key  either
                                     dscp   or  mark,  value  in  range  0  to
                                     4,294,967,295

       external_ids                  map of string-string pairs

   Details:
       priority: integer, in range 0 to 32,767
              The QoS rule‚Äôs priority. Rules with numerically higher  priority
              take precedence over those with lower. If two QoS rules with the
              same  priority  both  match,  then the one actually applied to a
              packet is undefined.

       direction: string, either from-lport or to-lport
              The value of this field is similar to  ACL  column  in  the  OVN
              Northbound database‚Äôs ACL table.

       match: string
              The packets that the QoS rules should match, in the same expres‚Äê
              sion  language  used  for the match column in the OVN Southbound
              database‚Äôs Logical_Flow table. The outport logical port is  only
              available  in the to-lport direction (the inport is available in
              both directions).

       action: map of string-integer pairs, key either dscp or mark, value in
       range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              When dscp action is specified, matching  flows  will  have  have
              DSCP  marking  applied.  When mark action is specified, matching
              flows will have packet marking applied.

              ‚Ä¢      dscp: The value of this action should be in the range  of
                     0 to 63 (inclusive).

              ‚Ä¢      mark: The value of this action should be a positive inte‚Äê
                     ger.

       bandwidth: map of string-integer pairs, key either burst or rate, value
       in range 1 to 4,294,967,295
              When  specified,  matching  packets will have bandwidth metering
              applied. Traffic over the limit will be dropped.

              ‚Ä¢      rate: The value of rate limit in kbps.

              ‚Ä¢      burst: The value of burst rate limit in kilobits. This is
                     optional and needs to specify the rate.

       external_ids: map of string-string pairs
              See External IDs at the beginning of this document.

Mirror TABLE
       Each row in this table represents a mirror that can be  used  for  port
       mirroring.  These  mirrors are referenced by the mirror_rules column in
       the Logical_Switch_Port table.

   Summary:
       name                          string (must be unique within table)
       filter                        string,  one  of  both,  from-lport,   or
                                     to-lport
       sink                          string
       type                          string,  one  of  erspan,  gre, local, or

       index                         integer
       mirror_rules                  set of Mirror_Rules
       external_ids                  map of string-string pairs

   Details:
       name: string (must be unique within table)
              Represents the name of the mirror.

       filter: string, one of both, from-lport, or to-lport
              The value of this field represents  selection  criteria  of  the
              mirror.  to-lport  mirrors the packets coming into logical port.
              from-lport mirrors the packets going out of logical  port.  both
              mirrors for both directions.

       sink: string
              The  value  of this field represents the destination/sink of the
              mirror. If the type is gre or erspan, the  value  indicates  the
              tunnel  remote  IP  (either  IPv4 or IPv6). For a type of local,
              this field defines a local  interface  on  the  OVS  integration
              bridge  to be used as the mirror destination. The interface must
              possess external-ids:mirror-id that matches this string.

       type: string, one of erspan, gre, local, or lport
              The value of this field specifies the mirror type - gre, erspan,
              local or lport.

       index: integer
              The value of this field represents the tunnel ID. If the config‚Äê
              ured tunnel type is gre, this field represents the GRE key value
              and if the configured tunnel type is erspan  it  represents  the
              erspan_idx value. It is ignored if the type is local.

       mirror_rules: set of Mirror_Rules
              The value of this field represents the mirror rule for filtering
              mirror traffic.

       external_ids: map of string-string pairs
              See External IDs at the beginning of this document.

Mirror_Rule TABLE
       Each  row  in  this table represents a mirror rule that can be used for
       filtering of lport mirrored traffic.

   Summary:
       match                         string
       action                        string, either mirror or skip
       priority                      integer, in range 0 to 32,767

   Details:
       match: string
              The match expression, describing which packets  should  be  exe‚Äê
              cuted  against  Mirror  Rule action. The Logical_Flow expression
              language is used.

       action: string, either mirror or skip
              The action to take when the Mirror Rule matches:

              ‚Ä¢      mirror: Mirror the matched packet.

              ‚Ä¢      skip: Do not mirror matched packet.

       priority: integer, in range 0 to 32,767
              The Mirror Rule priority. Rule with higher priority takes prece‚Äê
              dence over those with lower. A rule is  uniquely  identified  by
              the priority and match string.

Meter TABLE
       Each  row  in this table represents a meter that can be used for QoS or
       rate-limiting.

   Summary:
       name                          string (must be unique within table)
       unit                          string, either kbps or pktps
       bands                         set of 1 or more Meter_Bands
       fair                          optional boolean
       external_ids                  map of string-string pairs

   Details:
       name: string (must be unique within table)
              A name for this meter.

              Names that begin with "__" (two underscores)  are  reserved  for
              OVN internal use and should not be added manually.

       unit: string, either kbps or pktps
              The  unit for rate and burst_rate parameters in the bands entry.
              kbps specifies kilobits per second, and pktps specifies  packets
              per second.

       bands: set of 1 or more Meter_Bands
              The bands associated with this meter. Each band specifies a rate
              above  which  the band is to take the action action. If multiple
              bands‚Äô rates are exceeded, then the band with the  highest  rate
              among the exceeded bands is selected.

       fair: optional boolean
              This  column is used to further describe the desired behavior of
              the meter when there are multiple references to it. If this col‚Äê
              umn is empty or is set to false, the rate will be shared  across
              all  rows  that  refer  to the same Meter name. Conversely, when
              this column is set to true, each user of the same Meter will  be
              rate-limited on its own.

Meter_Band TABLE
       Each row in this table represents a meter band which specifies the rate
       above  which  the  configured action should be applied. These bands are
       referenced by the bands column in the Meter table.

   Summary:
       action                        string, must be drop
       rate                          integer, in range 1 to 4,294,967,295

       external_ids                  map of string-string pairs

   Details:
       action: string, must be drop
              The action to execute when this band matches. The only supported
              action is drop.

       rate: integer, in range 1 to 4,294,967,295
              The rate limit for this band, in kilobits per second or bits per
              second, depending on whether the parent Meter entry‚Äôs unit  col‚Äê
              umn specified kbps or pktps.

       burst_size: integer, in range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              The  maximum  burst allowed for the band in kilobits or packets,
              depending on whether kbps or pktps was selected  in  the  parent
              Meter  entry‚Äôs  unit  column. If the size is zero, the switch is
              free to select some reasonable value depending on its configura‚Äê
              tion.

       Status:
         status : hosting-chassis    optional string

   Details:
       name: string (must be unique within table)
              A name for the logical router port.

              In addition to provide convenience for  human  interaction  with
              the northbound database, this column is used as reference by its
              patch port in Logical_Switch_Port or another logical router port
              in Logical_Router_Port.

              A  logical  router  port may not have the same name as a logical
              switch port, but the database schema cannot enforce this.

       networks: set of strings
              The IP addresses  and  netmasks  of  the  router.  For  example,
              192.168.0.1/24   indicates  that  the  router‚Äôs  IP  address  is
              192.168.0.1 and that packets destined to 192.168.0.x  should  be
              routed to this port. These are optional.

              A  logical  router  port  always  adds a link-local IPv6 address
              (fe80::/64) automatically generated from the interface‚Äôs MAC ad‚Äê
              dress using the modified EUI-64 format.

       mac: string
              The Ethernet address that belongs to this router port.

       enabled: optional boolean
              This column is used to administratively set port state. If  this
              column  is empty or is set to true, the port is enabled. If this
              column is set to false, the port is disabled.  A  disabled  port
              has all ingress and egress traffic dropped.

       dhcp_relay: optional DHCP_Relay
              This  column  is  used  to  enabled  DHCP Relay. Please refer to
              DHCP_Relay table.

     Distributed Gateway Ports:

       Gateways, as documented under Gateways in the OVN  architecture  guide,
       provide  limited  connectivity  between  logical  networks and physical
       ones. OVN support multiple kinds of gateways.  The  Logical_Router_Port
       table  can  be used two different ways to configure distributed gateway
       ports, which are one kind of gateway. These two forms of  configuration
       exist for historical reasons. Both of them produce the same kind of OVN
       southbound records and the same behavior in practice.

       If  either of these are set, this logical router port represents a dis‚Äê
       tributed gateway port that connects this router  to  a  logical  switch
       with a localnet port or a connection to another OVN deployment.

       Also mentioned in the OVN architecture guide, distributed gateway ports
       can  also  be used for scalability reasons in deployments where logical
       switches are dedicated to chassises rather than distributed.

       The preferred way to configure a gateway is ha_chassis_group, but gate‚Ä‚Äê
       way_chassis is also supported for backward compatibility. Only  one  of
       these  should be set at a time on a given LRP, since they configure the
       same features.

       Even when a gateway is configured, the logical router port still effec‚Äê
       tively resides on each chassis. However, due to the implications of the
       use of L2 learning in the physical network, as well as the need to sup‚Äê
       port advanced features such as one-to-many NAT (aka IP masquerading), a
       subset of the logical router processing is  handled  in  a  centralized
       manner on the gateway chassis.

       There can be more than one distributed gateway ports configured on each
       logical  router, each connecting to different L2 segments. Load-balanc‚Äê
       ing is not yet supported on logical routers with more than one distrib‚Äê
       uted gateway ports.

       For each distributed gateway port, it may have more  than  one  gateway
       chassises.  When  more  than one gateway chassis is specified, OVN only
       uses one at a time. OVN can rely on OVS BFD implementation  to  monitor
       gateway  connectivity,  preferring the highest-priority gateway that is
       online. Priorities are  specified  in  the  priority  column  of  Gate‚Ä‚Äê
       way_Chassis or HA_Chassis.

       ovn-northd  programs  the  external_mac rules specified in the LRP‚Äôs LR
       into the peer logical switch‚Äôs destination lookup on the chassis  where
       the logical_port resides. In addition, the logical router‚Äôs MAC address
       is  automatically  programmed  in the peer logical switch‚Äôs destination
       lookup flow on the gateway chasssis. If it is desired to generate  gra‚Äê
       tuitous ARPs for NAT addresses, then set the peer LSP‚Äôs options:nat-ad‚Ä‚Äê
       dresses to router.

       OVN  20.03  and  earlier supported a third way to configure distributed
       gateway ports using options:redirect-chassis  to  specify  the  gateway
       chassis. This method is no longer supported. Any remaining users should
       switch  to  one  of the newer methods instead. A gateway_chassis may be
       easily configured from the command line, e.g.  ovn-nbctl  lrp-set-gate‚Ä‚Äê
       way-chassis lrp chassis.

       ha_chassis_group: optional HA_Chassis_Group
              Designates  an  HA_Chassis_Group  to provide gateway high avail‚Äê
              ability.

       gateway_chassis: set of Gateway_Chassises
              Designates one or more Gateway_Chassis for  the  logical  router
              port.

     Options for Physical VLAN MTU Issues:

       MTU  issues  arise  in  mixing  tunnels  with logical networks that are
       bridged to a physical VLAN. For an explanation of the MTU  issues,  see
       Physical  VLAN MTU Issues in the OVN architecture document. The follow‚Äê
       ing options, which are alternatives, provide solutions.  Both  of  them
       cause  packets  to  be  sent over localnet instead of tunnels, but they
       differ in whether some or all packets  are  sent  this  way.  The  most
       prominent  tradeoff  between  these  options  is  that  reside-on-redi‚Ä‚Äê
       rect-chassis is easier to configure  and  that  redirect-type  performs
       better for east-west traffic.

       options : reside-on-redirect-chassis: optional string, either true or
       false
              If  set to true, this option forces all traffic across the logi‚Äê
              cal router port to pass through the gateway chassis using a  hop
              across a localnet port. This changes behavior in two ways:

              ‚Ä¢      Without  this  option,  east-west traffic passes directly
                     between source and destination chassis (or even within  a
                     single  chassis,  for  co-located VMs). With this option,
                     all east-west traffic passes through the gateway chassis.

              ‚Ä¢      Without this option, traffic between the gateway  chassis
                     and  other  chassis is encapsulated in tunnels. With this
                     option, traffic passes over a localnet interface.

              This option may usefully be set only  on  logical  router  ports
              that  connect  a  distributed logical router to a logical switch
              with VIFs. It should not be set on a distributed gateway port.

              OVN honors this option only if the logical router  has  one  and
              only  one  distributed gateway port and if the LRP‚Äôs peer switch
              has a localnet port.

       options : redirect-type: optional string, either bridged or overlay
              If set to bridged on a distributed  gateway  port,  this  option
              causes OVN to redirect packets to the gateway chassis over a lo‚Ä‚Äê
              calnet port instead of a tunnel. The relevant chassis must share
              a localnet port.

              This  feature requires the administrator or the CMS to configure
              each participating chassis with a unique  Ethernet  address  for
              the  logical  router  by setting ovn-chassis-mac-mappings in the
              Open vSwitch database, for use by ovn-controller.

              Setting this option to overlay or leaving it unset  has  no  ef‚Äê
              fect.  This  option  may  usefully  be set only on a distributed
              gateway port when there is one and only one distributed  gateway
              port on the logical router. It is otherwise ignored.

       ipv6_prefix: set of strings
              This  column  contains IPv6 prefix obtained by prefix delegation
              router according to RFC 3633

     ipv6_ra_configs:

       This column defines the IPv6 ND RA address mode and ND MTU Option to be
       included by ovn-controller when it replies to the IPv6 Router solicita‚Äê
       tion requests.

       ipv6_ra_configs : address_mode: optional string
              The address mode to be used for IPv6 address configuration.  The
              supported values are:

              ‚Ä¢      slaac:  Address  configuration using Router Advertisement
                     (RA) packet. The  IPv6  prefixes  defined  in  the  Logi‚Ä‚Äê
                     cal_Router_Port  table‚Äôs networks column will be included
                     in the RA‚Äôs ICMPv6 option - Prefix information.

                     vertisement  (RA) packet. Other IPv6 options are provided
                     by DHCPv6.

       ipv6_ra_configs : router_preference: optional string
              Default Router Preference (PRF) indicates whether to prefer this
              router over other default routers (RFC  4191).  Possible  values
              are:

              ‚Ä¢      HIGH: mapped to 0x01 in RA PRF field

              ‚Ä¢      MEDIUM: mapped to 0x00 in RA PRF field

              ‚Ä¢      LOW: mapped to 0x11 in RA PRF field

       ipv6_ra_configs : route_info: optional string
              Route Info is used to configure Route Info Option sent in Router
              Advertisement according to RFC 4191. Route Info is a comma sepa‚Äê
              rated  string  where  each  field  provides PRF and prefix for a
              given route (e.g: HIGH-aef1::11/48,LOW-aef2::11/96) Possible PRF
              values are:

              ‚Ä¢      HIGH: mapped to 0x01 in RA PRF field

              ‚Ä¢      MEDIUM: mapped to 0x00 in RA PRF field

              ‚Ä¢      LOW: mapped to 0x11 in RA PRF field

       ipv6_ra_configs : mtu: optional string
              The recommended MTU for the link. Default is 0, which  means  no
              MTU  Option  will  be  included in RA packet replied by ovn-con‚Äê
              troller. Per RFC 2460, the mtu value is recommended no less than
              1280, so any mtu value less than 1280 will be considered  as  no
              MTU Option.

       ipv6_ra_configs : send_periodic: optional string
              If  set to true, then this router interface will send router ad‚Äê
              vertisements  periodically.  This  option  has  no   effect   if
              ipv6_ra_configs:address_mode is not set. The default is false.

       ipv6_ra_configs : max_interval: optional string
              The  maximum  number of seconds to wait between sending periodic
              router advertisements. This option has no effect if ipv6_ra_con‚Ä‚Äê
              figs:send_periodic is false. The default is 600.

       ipv6_ra_configs : min_interval: optional string
              The minimum number of seconds to wait between  sending  periodic
              router advertisements. This option has no effect if ipv6_ra_con‚Ä‚Äê
              figs:send_periodic   is  false.  The  default  is  one-third  of
              ipv6_ra_configs:max_interval, i.e. 200 seconds if  that  key  is
              unset.

       ipv6_ra_configs : rdnss: optional string
              IPv6 address of RDNSS server announced in RA packets. At the mo‚Äê
              ment OVN supports just one RDNSS server.

       ipv6_ra_configs : dnssl: optional string
              DNS  Search  List  announced  in RA packets. Multiple DNS Search
              List must be ‚Äôcomma‚Äô separated (e.g. "a.b.c, d.e.f")

     Options:

       Additional options for the logical router port.

       options : mcast_flood: optional string, either true or false
              If set to true, multicast traffic (including reports) are uncon‚Äê
              ditionally forwarded to the specific port.

              This option applies when the port is part of  a  logical  router
              which has options:mcast_relay set to true.

              Default: false.

       options : requested-tnl-key: optional string, containing an integer, in
       range 1 to 32,767
              Configures  the  port  binding  tunnel key for the port. Usually
              this is not needed because ovn-northd will assign an unique  key
              for   each  port  by  itself.  However,  if  it  is  configured,
              ovn-northd honors the configured value.

       options : prefix_delegation: optional string, either true or false
              If set to true, enable IPv6 prefix delegation state  machine  on
              this  logical  router  port (RFC3633). IPv6 prefix delegation is
              available just on a gateway router or on a gateway router port.

       options : prefix: optional string, either true or false
              If set to true, this interface will receive an IPv6  prefix  ac‚Äê
              cording to RFC3663

       options : route_table: optional string
              Designates  lookup  for  Logical_Router_Static_Routes  with  the
              specified route_table value. See detailed explanation for routes
              lookup behavior in Logical_Router_Static_Route:route_table field
              description.

       options : gateway_mtu: optional string, containing an integer, in range
       68 to 65,535
              If set, logical flows will be added to router pipeline to  check
              packet  length.  If packet length is greater than the value set,
              ICMPv4 type 3 (Destination Unreachable)  code  4  (Fragmentation
              Needed  and Don‚Äôt Fragment was Set) or ICMPv6 type 2 (Packet Too
              Big) code 0 (no route to destination) packets will be generated.
              This allows for Path MTU Discovery.

       options : routing-protocol-redirect: optional string
              This option expects a name  of  a  Logical  Switch  Port  that‚Äôs
              present  in  the  peer‚Äôs  Logical  Switch. If set, it causes any
              traffic that‚Äôs destined for Logical Router Port‚Äôs  IP  addresses
              (including  its  IPv6 LLA) and the ports associated with routing
              protocols defined ip routing-protocols option, to be  redirected
              to the specified Logical Switch Port. This allows external rout‚Äê
              ing  daemons  to  be bound to a port in OVN‚Äôs Logical Switch and
              act as if they were listening on Logical Router  Port‚Äôs  IP  ad‚Äê
              dresses.

       options : routing-protocols: optional string
              This option expects a comma-separated list of routing, and rout‚Äê
              ing-related protocols, whose control plane traffic will be redi‚Äê
              rected  to a port specified in routing-protocol-redirect option.
              Currently supported options are:

              ‚Ä¢      BGP (forwards TCP port 179)

              ‚Ä¢      BFD (forwards UDP port 3784)

              Note that for BGP to work in "unnumbered mode" (advertising IPv4
              routes over IPv6 network, with automatic  on-link  peer  discov‚Äê
              ery),  Logical  Router  Port needs to enable sending of periodic
              IPv6 Router Announcements  (see  the  ipv6_ra_configs:send_peri‚Ä‚Äê
              odic). Recommended minimal configuration of periodic RAs for BGP
              unnumbered:

              ‚Ä¢      ipv6_ra_configs:address_mode  = slaac (Any valid value is
                     OK, but the option needs to be set)

              ‚Ä¢      ipv6_ra_configs:send_periodic = true

              ‚Ä¢      ipv6_ra_configs:max_interval = 10

              ‚Ä¢      ipv6_ra_configs:min_interval = 5
       Feel free to adjust max and min interval values, but be aware that they
       influence speed at which the initial BGP session is  established.  With
       the  above  values, the session will be established in 5 to 10 seconds.
       Please refer to RFC 8950 for more details about advertising  IPv4  net‚Äê
       works over IPv6 next-hop addresses.

       options : gateway_mtu_bypass: optional string
              When  configured, represents a match expression, in the same ex‚Äê
              pression language used for the match column in  the  OVN  South‚Äê
              bound  database‚Äôs  Logical_Flow table. Packets matching this ex‚Äê
              pression will bypass the length check configured through the op‚Ä‚Äê
              tions:gateway_mtu option.

       options : ic-route-tag: optional string
              This option expects a name of a route-tag that‚Äôs present in  the
              Logical  Router  Port. If set, it causes any route advertised by
              the Logical Router Port to include the route-tag in the   exter‚Ä‚Äê
              nal_ids  register of the advertised route entry in the Route ta‚Äê
              ble  of  the  OVN_IC_Southbound database. This allows to tag and
              filter route tags in the process  of  advertising  and  learning
              routes in ovn-ic daemon.

       options : ic-route-filter-tag: optional string
              This  option  expects  a  name  of  a  filtered route-tag that‚Äôs
              present in the Logical Router Port. If set, it causes any  route
              learned by the Logical Router Port with the route-tag present in
              the  external_ids  register of the advertised route entry in the
              Route table of the OVN_IC_Southbound database, will be  filtered
              and not learned by the ovn-ic daemon.

       options : requested-chassis: optional string
              If set, identifies a specific chassis (by name or hostname) that
              is  allowed  to  bind  this  port. This option is valid only for
              chassis that have options:is-remote=true,  in  other  words  for
              chassis  that are in different Availability zone. The option ac‚Äê
              cepts only single value.

              By assigning remote chassis the Logical_Router gains  status  of
              Transit Router see Logical_Router table for more details.

       options : dynamic-routing-redistribute: optional string
              Only relevant if options:dynamic-routing on the respective Logi‚Äê
              cal_Router is set to true.

              This is a list of elements separated by ,.

              If  connected  is  in  the list then northd will synchronize all
              "connected" routes to  the  southbound  Advertised_Route  table.
              "Connected" here means routes implicitly created by networks as‚Äê
              sociated with the LRPs.

              If  connected-as-host  is in the list then northd will enumerate
              all actively used individual IPs of a "connected" route and  an‚Äê
              nounce  these  IPs as host routes instead of announcing the sub‚Äê
              net. This includes LSP and LRP addresses on the network as  well
              as  NAT  entries of remove Logical_Routers on this network. Set‚Äê
              ting this implies the setting connected.  This  setting  can  be
              used to:

              ‚Ä¢      allow  the  fabric outside of OVN to drop traffic towards
                     IP addresses that are not  actually  used.  This  traffic
                     would otherwise hit this LR and then be dropped.

              ‚Ä¢      If  this  LR has multiple LRPs connected to the fabric on
                     different chassis: allows the fabric outside  of  OVN  to
                     steer  packets  to  the  chassis which already hosts this
                     backing ip address.

              If static is in the list then northd will synchronize all  Logi‚Ä‚Äê
              cal_Router_Static_Route  to  the southbound Advertised_Route ta‚Äê
              ble.

              If lb is in the list then northd will create entries  in  Adver‚Ä‚Äê
              tised_Route  table  for  each  Load  Balancer VIP on this port‚Äôs
              router, and it‚Äôs neighboring routers.  Neighboring  routers  are
              those  that are either directly connected to this Logical Router
              Port, or those that are connected via shared Logical Switch.

              If nat is in the list then northd will create entries in  Adver‚Ä‚Äê
              tised_Route  table  for  each  NAT‚Äôs  external IP on this port‚Äôs
              router, and it‚Äôs neighboring routers.  Neighboring  routers  are
              those  that are either directly connected to this Logical Router
              Port, or those that are connected via shared Logical Switch.

              If not set the value  from  options:dynamic-routing-redistribute
              on the Logical_Router will be used.

       options : dynamic-routing-redistribute-local-only: optional string, ei‚Äê
       ther true or false
              Only relevant if options:dynamic-routing is set to true.

              This  controls  whether  ovn-controller  will  advertise  Adver‚Ä‚Äê
              tised_Route records only on the chassis where their tracked_port
              is bound.

              If not set the value from  options:dynamic-routing-redistribute-
              local-only on the Logical_Router will be used.

       options : dynamic-routing-maintain-vrf: optional string, either true or
       false
              Only relevant if options:dynamic-routing on the respective Logi‚Äê
              cal_Router is set to true.

              If  this  LRP  is  bound to a specific chassis then the ovn-con‚Äê
              troller of this chassis will maintain a vrf. This vrf will  con‚Äê
              tain  all the routes that should be announced from this LRP. Un‚Äê
              less options:dynamic-routing-vrf-name is set  the  vrf  will  be
              named  "ovnvrf" with the options:dynamic-routing-vrf-id or data‚Äê
              path id of the Logical Router appended to it.

              If the setting is not set or false the ovn-controller  will  ex‚Äê
              pect  this  VRF  to  already  exist. Some tooling outside of OVN
              needs to ensure this.

              The VRF table ID is the same as the  tunnel  key  of  the  Logi‚Äê
              cal_Router  datapath.  If this setting is false the tooling out‚Äê
              side of OVN needs to ensure that this is the case.

       options : dynamic-routing-port-name: optional string
              Only relevant if options:dynamic-routing on the respective Logi‚Äê
              cal_Router is set to true. Only learn routes associated with the
              interface locally bound to the LSP or LRP specified  here.  This
              allows  a  single  chassis to learn different routes on separate
              LRPs bound to this chassis. This is usefully e.g. in the case of
              a chassis with multiple links towards the network  fabric  where
              all  of  them run BGP individually. This option allows to have a
              1:1 mapping between a single LRP and an individual link. If  the
              port  referenced  by  this name is bound locally on the ovn-con‚Äê
              troller we lookup the linux interface name of  this  port.  This
              interface  name  is  then  used for the route filtering, so only
              routes that have this interface as nexthop will be  learned.  As
              there  might  not  always  be  such a port bound on the ovn-con‚Äê
              troller this value can also be an arbitrary string. The ovn-con‚Äê
              troller will lookup the port name in the local  external_ids:dy‚Ä‚Äê
              namic-routing-port-mapping.  This  is a list separated by , that
              contains port=interfacename pairs. If a match is found in  there
              the configured interface name is used instead of the autodiscov‚Äê
              ery. Also it is then irrelevant if the port is bound locally.

       options : ic-route-filter-adv: optional string
              This  option  expects  list  of  CIDRs  delimited  by "," that‚Äôs
              present in the Logical Router Port. A route will  be  advertised
              if  the  route‚Äôs prefix belongs to any of the CIDRs listed. This
              allows to filter CIDR prefixes in  the  process  of  advertising
              routes in ovn-ic daemon.

       options : ic-route-filter-learn: optional string
              This  option  expects  list  of  CIDRs  delimited  by "," that‚Äôs
              present in the Logical Router Port. A route will be  learned  if
              the  route‚Äôs prefix belongs to any of the CIDRs listed. This al‚Äê
              lows to filter CIDR prefixes in the process of  learning  routes
              in ovn-ic daemon.

       options : ic-route-deny-adv: optional string
              This  option  expects  list  of  CIDRs  delimited  by "," that‚Äôs
              present in the Logical Router Port. A route will not  be  adver‚Äê
              tised  if the route‚Äôs prefix belongs to any of the CIDRs listed.
              This allows to filter CIDR prefixes in the process of  advertis‚Äê
              ing routes in ovn-ic daemon.

       options : ic-route-deny-learn: optional string
              This  option  expects  list  of  CIDRs  delimited  by "," that‚Äôs
              present in the Logical Router Port. A route will not be  learned
              if  the  route‚Äôs prefix belongs to any of the CIDRs listed. This
              allows to filter CIDR prefixes in the process of learning routes
              in ovn-ic daemon.

       options : dynamic-routing-no-learning: optional string, either true or
       false
              Only relevant if options:dynamic-routing is set to true.

              This option disables route learning on a  specific  router  port
              and  will  also remove learned routes. It also has priority over
              the router version of this option.

     Attachment:

       A given router port serves one of two purposes:

              ‚Ä¢      To attach a logical switch to a logical router. A logical
                     router port of this type is  referenced  by  exactly  one
                     Logical_Switch_Port  of type router. The value of name is
                     set  as  router-port   in   column   options   of   Logi‚Ä‚Äê
                     cal_Switch_Port. In this case peer column is empty.

              ‚Ä¢      To connect one logical router to another. This requires a
                     pair of logical router ports, each connected to a differ‚Äê
                     ent  router.  Each  router port in the pair specifies the
                     other in its peer column. No Logical_Switch refers to the
                     router port.

       peer: optional string
              For a router port used to  connect  two  logical  routers,  this
              identifies the other router port in the pair by name.

              For  a  router port attached to a logical switch, this column is
              empty.

     Common Columns:

       external_ids: map of string-string pairs
              See External IDs at the beginning of this document.

              The ovn-northd program copies all these pairs  into  the  exter‚Ä‚Äê
              nal_ids column of the Port_Binding table in OVN_Southbound data‚Äê
              base.

     Status:

       Additional status about the logical router port.

       status : hosting-chassis: optional string
              This option is populated by ovn-northd.

              When  a  distributed  gateway port is bound to a location in the
              OVN Southbound database Port_Binding  ovn-northd  will  populate
              this  key with the name of the Chassis that is currently hosting
              this port.

Logical_Router_Static_Route TABLE
       Each record represents a static route.

       When multiple routes match a packet, the longest-prefix match  is  cho‚Äê
       sen.  For  a  given  prefix  length, a dst-ip route is preferred over a
       src-ip route.

       When there are ECMP routes, i.e. multiple routes with same  prefix  and
       policy,  one  of  them will be selected based on the 5-tuple hashing of
       the packet header.

   Summary:
       ip_prefix                     string
       policy                        optional string, either dst-ip or src-ip
       nexthop                       string
       output_port                   optional string

       Common Columns:
         external_ids                map of string-string pairs
       Common options:
         options                     map of string-string pairs
         options : ecmp_symmetric_reply
                                     optional string
         options : origin            optional string

   Details:
       ip_prefix: string
              IP prefix of this route (e.g. 192.168.100.0/24).

       policy: optional string, either dst-ip or src-ip
              If it is specified, this setting describes the  policy  used  to
              make  routing decisions. This setting must be one of the follow‚Äê
              ing strings:

              ‚Ä¢      src-ip: This policy sends the packet to the nexthop  when
                     the packet‚Äôs source IP address matches ip_prefix.

              ‚Ä¢      dst-ip:  This policy sends the packet to the nexthop when
                     the packet‚Äôs destination IP address matches ip_prefix.

              If not specified, the default is dst-ip.

       nexthop: string
              Nexthop IP address for this route. Nexthop IP address should  be
              the IP address of a connected router port or the IP address of a
              logical port or can be set to discard for dropping packets which
              match the given route.

       output_port: optional string
              The  name  of the Logical_Router_Port via which the packet needs
              to be sent out. This is optional and  when  not  specified,  OVN
              will  automatically  figure  this out based on the nexthop. When
              this is specified and there are multiple  IP  addresses  on  the
              router  port and none of them are in the same subnet of nexthop,
              OVN chooses the first IP address as the one via which  the  nex‚Ä‚Äê
              thop is reachable.

       bfd: optional weak reference to BFD
              Reference to BFD row if the route has associated a BFD session

       selection_fields: set of strings, one of eth_dst, eth_src, ip_dst,
       ip_proto, ip_src, ipv6_dst, ipv6_src, tp_dst, or tp_src
              ECMP routes use OpenFlow groups of type select to pick a nexthop
              among the list of available nexthops. OVS supports two selection
              methods: dp_hash and hash for hash computation and selecting the
              buckets of a group. OVN by default uses dp_hash. In order to use
              the  hash  selection method, specify the allowed match fields in
              selection fields. Please see the  OVS  documentation  (man  ovs-
              ofctl) for more details on selection methods and fields.

              To  match  on Layer 4 ports use tp_src and tp_dst. This match is
              applicable only for TCP, UDP, SCTP and will be ignored  for  all
              other  IP  packets.  When  matching  on  Layer 4 ports, match on
              ip_proto will be implicitly added in the select action.

              Example: {ip_proto,ip_src,ip_dst} for a 3-tuple match.  Example:
              {ip_proto,ipv6_src,ipv6_dst}   for   an   IPv6  match.  Example:
              {ip_proto,ip_src,ip_dst,tp_src,tp_dst}.                 Example:
              {ip_src,ip_dst,ipv6_src,ipv6_dst,tp_src,tp_dst}.

       route_table: string
              Specify  any  string to assign a route to a separate routing ta‚Äê
              ble. When a Logical Router Port has a configured  value  in  op‚Ä‚Äê
              tions:route_table,  only static routes with the same routing ta‚Äê
              ble value are considered. A more  detailed  description  of  the
              route lookup behavior is provided below:

              When  a  packet enters Logical Router (LR), it examines the fol‚Äê
              lowing list of routes:

              ‚Ä¢      All routes to directly connected networks of the LR  (in‚Äê
                     cluding networks that are learned from other availability
                     zones within the same LR through OVN-IC).

              ‚Ä¢      All  static routes of the LR that have the same route_ta‚Ä‚Äê
                     ble field value as that of the Logical Router Port‚Äôs  op‚Ä‚Äê
                     tions:route_table (If the option is absent, static routes
                     with an empty route_table field are considered).

              From  the  resulting  list of routes, the route with the longest
              prefix match takes precedence over others.

       external_ids : ic-learned-route: optional string
              ovn-ic populates this key if  the  route  is  learned  from  the
              global  OVN_IC_Southbound  database. In this case the value will
              be  set  to  the  uuid  of  the  row  in  Route  table  of   the
              OVN_IC_Southbound database.

     Common Columns:

       external_ids: map of string-string pairs
              See External IDs at the beginning of this document.

     Common options:

       options: map of string-string pairs
              This  column  provides general key/value settings. The supported
              options are described individually below.

       options : ecmp_symmetric_reply: optional string
              If true, then

              ‚Ä¢      New ingress-originated traffic  that  arrives  over  this
                     route  will  have its reply traffic bypass ECMP route se‚Äê
                     lection and will be sent out this route instead.

              ‚Ä¢      For the  egress-originated  traffic,  the  ingress  reply
                     traffic route gets saved. And the subsequent traffic will
                     bypass  ECMP  route selection and instead be sent out the
                     same route.

              Note that this option overrides  any  rules  set  in  the  Logi‚Ä‚Äê
              cal_Router_policy  table.  This  option  only  works  on gateway
              routers (routers that have options:chassis set).

       options : origin: optional string
              In case ovn-interconnection has been learned this route, it will
              have its origin set: either "connected" or "static". This key is
              supposed to be written only by ovn-ic  daemon.  ovn-northd  then
              checks   this   value   when  generating  Logical  Flows.  Logi‚Ä‚Äê
              cal_Router_Static_Route records with same ip_prefix within  same
              Logical  Router  will have next lookup order based on origin key
              value:

              1.  connected

              2.  static
Logical_Router_Policy TABLE
       Each row in this table represents one  routing  policy  for  a  logical
       router that points to it through its policies column. The action column
       for  the  highest-priority  matching  row  in  this  table determines a
       packet‚Äôs treatment. If no row matches, packets are allowed by  default.
       (Default-deny  treatment  is possible: add a rule with priority 0, 1 as
       match, and drop as action.)

   Summary:
       priority                      integer, in range 0 to 32,767

       Common Columns:
         external_ids                map of string-string pairs

   Details:
       priority: integer, in range 0 to 32,767
              The routing policy‚Äôs priority.  Rules  with  numerically  higher
              priority  take  precedence  over  those  with  lower.  A rule is
              uniquely identified by the priority, chain and match string.

       chain: optional string
              The routing policy rule‚Äôs chain  name.  Only  rules  with  empty
              chain  name are traversed by default. Other chains are traversed
              as response to jump action.

       match: string
              The packets that the routing policy should match,  in  the  same
              expression  language used for the match column in the OVN South‚Äê
              bound database‚Äôs Logical_Flow table.

              By default all traffic is allowed. When writing a more  restric‚Äê
              tive  policy, it is important to remember to allow flows such as
              ARP and IPv6 neighbor discovery packets.

       action: string, one of allow, drop, jump, or reroute
              The action to take when the routing policy matches:

              ‚Ä¢      allow: Forward the packet.

              ‚Ä¢      drop: Silently drop the packet.

              ‚Ä¢      reroute: Reroute packet to nexthop or nexthops.

              ‚Ä¢      jump: Start examining rules  that  have  the  same  chain
                     value as specified in jump_chain.

       jump_chain: optional string
              The  routing  policy  rule‚Äôs  chain name selected to be examined
              next.

       nexthop: optional string
              Note: This column is deprecated in favor of nexthops and is  ig‚Äê
              nored by northd.

              Next-hop  IP  address for this route, which should be the IP ad‚Äê
              dress of a connected router port or the IP address of a  logical
              port.

       nexthops: set of strings
              Next-hop  ECMP  IP addresses for this route. Each IP in the list
              should be the IP address of a connected router port  or  the  IP
              address of a logical port.

              One IP from the list is selected as next hop.

       output_port: optional weak reference to Logical_Router_Port
              The  Logical_Router_Port  via  which the packet needs to be sent
              out. This is optional and when not specified, OVN will automati‚Äê
              cally figure this out based on the nexthops column. When this is
              specified and there are multiple IP addresses on the router port
              and none of them are in the same subnet of nexthops, OVN chooses
              the first IP address as the  one  via  which  the  nexthops  are
              reachable.  NOTE:  for  now OVN does not support configuring the
              output port on ECMP reroute policies (with more than  one  value
              in the nexthops column).

       bfd_sessions: set of weak reference to BFDs
              Reference to BFD row if the route policy has associated some BFD
              sessions.

       options : pkt_mark: optional string
              Marks the packet with the value specified when the router policy
              is applied. CMS can inspect this packet marker and take some de‚Äê
              cisions  if desired. This value is not preserved when the packet
              goes out on the wire.

     Common Columns:

       external_ids: map of string-string pairs
              See External IDs at the beginning of this document.

NAT TABLE
       Each record represents a NAT rule.

   Summary:
       type                          string, one of  dnat,  dnat_and_snat,  or

       options : stateless           optional string
       options : add_route           optional string
       Common Columns:
         external_ids                map of string-string pairs

   Details:
       type: string, one of dnat, dnat_and_snat, or snat
              Type of the NAT rule.

              ‚Ä¢      When type is dnat, the externally visible IP address  ex‚Ä‚Äê
                     ternal_ip  is DNATted to the IP address logical_ip in the
                     logical space.

              ‚Ä¢      When type is snat, IP packets with their  source  IP  ad‚Äê
                     dress that either matches the IP address in logical_ip or
                     is  in  the network provided by logical_ip is SNATed into
                     the IP address in external_ip.

              ‚Ä¢      When type is dnat_and_snat, the externally visible IP ad‚Äê
                     dress external_ip is DNATted to the IP address logical_ip
                     in the logical space. In addition, IP  packets  with  the
                     source  IP address that matches logical_ip is SNATed into
                     the IP address in external_ip.

       external_ip: string
              An IPv4 address.

       external_mac: optional string
              A MAC address.

              This is only used on the gateway port  on  distributed  routers.
              This must be specified in order for the NAT rule to be processed
              in a distributed manner on all chassis. If this is not specified
              for  a NAT rule on a distributed router, then this NAT rule will
              be processed in a centralized manner on  the  gateway  port  in‚Äê
              stance on the gateway chassis.

              This  MAC  address must be unique on the logical switch that the
              gateway port is attached to. If the MAC address used on the log‚Ä‚Äê
              ical_port is globally unique, then that MAC address can be spec‚Äê
              ified as this external_mac.

       external_port_range: string
              L4 source port range

              Range of ports, from which a port number  will  be  picked  that
              will  replace the source port of to be NATed packet. This is ba‚Äê
              sically PAT (port address translation).

              Value of the column is in the format, port_lo-port_hi. For exam‚Äê
              ple: external_port_range : "1-30000"

              Valid range of ports is 1-65535.

       logical_ip: string
              An IPv4 network (e.g 192.168.1.0/24) or an IPv4 address.

       logical_port: optional string
              The name of the logical port where the logical_ip resides.

              This is only used on distributed routers. This must be specified
              in order for the NAT rule to be processed in a distributed  man‚Äê
              ner on all chassis. If this is not specified for a NAT rule on a
              distributed  router,  then  this NAT rule will be processed in a
              centralized manner on the gateway port instance on  the  gateway
              chassis.

       allowed_ext_ips: optional Address_Set
              It  represents  Address Set of external ips that NAT rule is ap‚Äê
              plicable to. For SNAT type NAT rules, this refers to destination
              addresses. For DNAT type NAT rules, this refers  to  source  ad‚Äê
              dresses.

              This  configuration overrides the default NAT behavior of apply‚Äê
              ing a rule solely based on internal IP. Without this  configura‚Äê
              tion,  NAT  happens  without  considering  the  external IP (i.e
              dest/source for snat/dnat type rule).  With  this  configuration
              NAT  rule is applied ONLY if external ip is in the input Address
              Set.

       exempted_ext_ips: optional Address_Set
              It represents Address Set of external ips that NAT rule  is  NOT
              applicable  to. For SNAT type NAT rules, this refers to destina‚Äê
              tion addresses. For DNAT type NAT rules, this refers  to  source
              addresses.

              This  configuration overrides the default NAT behavior of apply‚Äê
              ing a rule solely based on internal IP. Without this  configura‚Äê
              tion,  NAT  happens  without  considering  the  external IP (i.e
              dest/source for snat/dnat type rule).  With  this  configuration
              NAT  rule  is NOT applied if external ip is in the input Address
              Set.

              If there are NAT rules in a logical router with  overlapping  IP
              prefixes  (including /32), then usage of exempted_ext_ips should
              be avoided in following scenario.  a.  SNAT  rule  (let  us  say
              RULE1)  with logical_ip PREFIX/MASK (let us say 50.0.0.0/24). b.
              SNAT rule (let us say RULE2) with logical_ip PREFIX/MASK+1  (let
              us  say  50.0.0.0/25). c. Now, if exempted_ext_ips is associated
              with RULE2, then a logical ip which matches both 50.0.0.0/24 and
              50.0.0.0/25 may get the RULE2 applied to it instead of RULE1.

              allowed_ext_ips and exempted_ext_ips are mutually  exclusive  to
              each  other.  If  both Address Sets are set for a rule, then the
              NAT rule is not considered.

       gateway_port: optional weak reference to Logical_Router_Port
              A distributed gateway  port  in  the  Logical_Router_Port  table
              where the NAT rule needs to be applied.

              When multiple distributed gateway ports are configured on a Log‚Ä‚Äê
              ical_Router,  applying  a  NAT  rule  at each of the distributed
              gateway ports might not be desired. Consider the  case  where  a
              logical router has 2 distributed gateway port, one with networks
              50.0.0.10/24  and  the  other with networks 60.0.0.10/24. If the
              logical  router  has  a  NAT  rule  of  type  snat,   logical_ip
              10.1.1.0/24  and  external_ip 50.1.1.20/24, the rule needs to be
              selectively applied on matching packets entering/leaving through
              the distributed gateway port with networks 50.0.0.10/24.

              When a logical router has multiple distributed gateway ports and
              this column is not set for a NAT rule, then the rule will be ap‚Äê
              plied at the distributed gateway port which is in the same  net‚Äê
              work  as  the external_ip of the NAT rule, if such a router port
              exists. If logical router has a single distributed gateway  port
              and  this column is not set for a NAT rule, the rule will be ap‚Äê
              plied at the distributed gateway port even if the router port is
              not in the same network as the external_ip of the NAT rule.

       match: string
              The packets that the NAT rules should match, in addition to  the
              match that is created based on the NAT type, in the same expres‚Äê
              sion  language  used  for the match column in the OVN Southbound
              database‚Äôs Logical_Flow table. This allows for more fine-grained
              control over the NAT rule.

       priority: integer, in range 0 to 32,767
              The NAT rule‚Äôs priority. Rules with numerically higher  priority
              take  precedence  over  those  with lower. The priority is taken
              into account only if the match is defined.

       options : stateless: optional string
              Indicates if a dnat_and_snat  rule  should  lead  to  connection
              tracking state or not.

       options : add_route: optional string
              If  set  to  true, then neighbor routers will have logical flows
              added that will allow for routing to the NAT  address.  It  also
              will  have  ARP  resolution logical flows added. By setting this
              option,  it  means  there  is  no  reason  to  create  a   Logi‚Ä‚Äê
              cal_Router_Static_Route  from  neighbor  routers to this NAT ad‚Äê
              dress. It also means that no ARP request is required for  neigh‚Äê
              bor  routers  to  learn the IP-MAC mapping for this NAT address.
              This option only applies to NATs of type dnat and dnat_and_snat.
              For more information about what flows are added for  IP  routes,
              please see the ovn-northd manpage section on IP Routing.

DHCP_Options TABLE
       OVN  implements  native  DHCPv4  support which caters to the common use
       case of providing an IPv4 address to a booting  instance  by  providing
       stateless replies to DHCPv4 requests based on statically configured ad‚Äê
       dress  mappings. To do this it allows a short list of DHCPv4 options to
       be configured and applied at each compute host running ovn-controller.

       OVN also implements native  DHCPv6  support  which  provides  stateless
       replies to DHCPv6 requests.

              cal_Switch_Port.  If  Hostname  option value is set in both con‚Äê
              flicting  Logical_Switch_Port  and  DHCP_Options  tables,  Logi‚Ä‚Äê
              cal_Switch_Port takes precedence.

       options : domain_name: optional string
              The DHCPv4 option code for this option is 15. This option speci‚Äê
              fies the domain name that client should use when resolving host‚Äê
              names via the Domain Name System.

       options : bootfile_name_alt: optional string
              "bootfile_name_alt"  option  is  used to support iPXE. When both
              "bootfile_name" and "bootfile_name_alt" are provided by the CMS,
              "bootfile_name" will be used for option 67 if the  dhcp  request
              contains  etherboot  option (175), otherwise "bootfile_name_alt"
              will be used.

       options : broadcast_address: optional string
              The DHCPv4 option code for this option is 28. This option speci‚Äê
              fies the IP address used as a broadcast address.

       These options accept string value which is a comma  separated  list  of
       domain names. The domain names are encoded based on RFC 1035.

       options : domain_search_list: optional string
              The DHCPv4 option code for this option is 119.

     DHCPv6 options:

       OVN  also  implements  native DHCPv6 support. The CMS should define the
       set of DHCPv6 options as key/value pairs.  The  define  DHCPv6  options
       will  be  included  in  the  DHCPv6  response to the DHCPv6 Solicit/Re‚Äê
       quest/Confirm packet from the logical ports having the  IPv6  addresses
       in the cidr.

     Mandatory DHCPv6 options:

       The following options must be defined.

       options : server_id: optional string
              The  Ethernet  address  for the DHCP server to use. This is also
              included in the DHCPv6 reply as option 2, ``Server  Identifier‚Äô‚Äô
              to  carry  a  DUID  identifying  a server between a client and a
              server. ovn-controller defines DUID based on Link-layer  Address
              [DUID-LL].

     IPv6 DHCPv6 options:

       Below  are  the  supported  DHCPv6 options whose values are an IPv6 ad‚Äê
       dress, e.g. aef0::4. Some options accept multiple  IPv6  addresses  en‚Äê
       closed  within  curly  braces, e.g. {aef0::4, aef0::5}. Please refer to
       RFC 3315 for more details on DHCPv6 options and their codes.

       options : dns_server: optional string
              The DHCPv6 option code for this option is 23. This option speci‚Äê
              fies the DNS servers that the VM should use.

     String DHCPv6 options:

       These options accept string values.

       options : domain_search: optional string
              The DHCPv6 option code for this option is 24. This option speci‚Äê
              fies the domain search list the client  should  use  to  resolve
              hostnames with DNS.

              Example: "ovn.org".

       options : dhcpv6_stateless: optional string
              This  option specifies the OVN native DHCPv6 will work in state‚Äê
              less mode, which means OVN native DHCPv6 will not offer IPv6 ad‚Äê
              dresses for VM/VIF ports, but only reply  other  configurations,
              such  as  DNS  and  domain search list. When setting this option
              with string value "true", VM/VIF will configure  IPv6  addresses
              by stateless way. Default value for this option is false.

       options : fqdn: optional string
              The  DHCPv6 option code for this option is 39. If set, indicates
              the DHCPv6 option "FQDN".

   Details:
     Core Features:

       target: string (must be unique within table)
              Connection methods for clients.

              The following connection methods are currently supported:

              ssl:host[:port]
                     The specified SSL/TLS port on the host at the given host,
                     which can either be a DNS name (if built with unbound li‚Äê
                     brary)  or  an  IP address. A valid SSL/TLS configuration
                     must be provided when this form is used, this  configura‚Äê
                     tion can be specified via command-line options or the SSL
                     table.

                     If port is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

                     SSL/TLS support is an optional feature that is not always
                     built as part of OVN or Open vSwitch.

              tcp:host[:port]
                     The  specified  TCP  port  on the host at the given host,
                     which can either be a DNS name (if built with unbound li‚Äê
                     brary) or an IP address. If host is an IPv6 address, wrap
                     it in square brackets, e.g. tcp:[::1]:6640.

                     If port is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

              pssl:[port][:host]
                     Listens for SSL/TLS  connections  on  the  specified  TCP
                     port. Specify 0 for port to have the kernel automatically
                     choose  an available port. If host, which can either be a
                     DNS name (if built with unbound library)  or  an  IP  ad‚Äê
                     dress,  is  specified, then connections are restricted to
                     the resolved or specified local IPaddress (either IPv4 or
                     IPv6 address). If host is an IPv6 address, wrap in square
                     brackets, e.g. pssl:6640:[::1]. If host is not  specified
                     then  it listens only on IPv4 (but not IPv6) addresses. A
                     valid SSL/TLS configuration must be  provided  when  this
                     form  is  used, this can be specified either via command-
                     line options or the SSL table.

                     If port is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

                     SSL/TLS support is an optional feature that is not always
                     built as part of OVN or Open vSwitch.

              ptcp:[port][:host]
                     Listens for connections on the specified TCP port.  Spec‚Äê
                     ify 0 for port to have the kernel automatically choose an
                     available  port.  If host, which can either be a DNS name
                     (if built with unbound library)  or  an  IP  address,  is
                     specified,  then  connections  are  restricted to the re‚Äê
                     solved or specified local IP address (either IPv4 or IPv6
                     address). If host is an IPv6 address, wrap it  in  square
                     brackets,  e.g. ptcp:6640:[::1]. If host is not specified
                     then it listens only on IPv4 addresses.

                     If port is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

              When multiple clients are configured, the target values must  be
              unique. Duplicate target values yield unspecified results.

     Client Failure Detection and Handling:

       max_backoff: optional integer, at least 1,000
              Maximum  number  of  milliseconds to wait between connection at‚Äê
              tempts. Default is implementation-specific.

       inactivity_probe: optional integer
              Maximum number of milliseconds of idle time on connection to the
              client before sending  an  inactivity  probe  message.  If  Open
              vSwitch  does  not communicate with the client for the specified
              number of seconds, it will send a probe. If a  response  is  not
              received  for  the  same additional amount of time, Open vSwitch
              assumes the connection has been broken and  attempts  to  recon‚Äê
              nect.  Default is implementation-specific. A value of 0 disables
              inactivity probes.

     Status:

       Key-value pair of is_connected is always updated. Other key-value pairs
       in the status columns may be updated depends on the target type.

       When target specifies a connection method that listens for inbound con‚Äê
       nections (e.g. ptcp: or punix:), both  n_connections  and  is_connected
       may also be updated while the remaining key-value pairs are omitted.

       On  the  other  hand, when target specifies an outbound connection, all
       key-value pairs may be updated, except  the  above-mentioned  two  key-
       value  pairs associated with inbound connection targets. They are omit‚Äê
       ted.

       is_connected: boolean
              true if currently connected to this client, false otherwise.

       status : last_error: optional string
              A human-readable description of the last error on the connection
              to the manager; i.e. strerror(errno). This key will  exist  only
              if an error has occurred.

       status : state: optional string, one of ACTIVE, BACKOFF, CONNECTING,
       IDLE, or VOID
              The state of the connection to the manager:

              VOID   Connection is disabled.

              BACKOFF
                     Attempting to reconnect at an increasing period.

              CONNECTING
                     Attempting to connect.

              ACTIVE Connected, remote host responsive.

              IDLE   Connection is idle. Waiting for response to keep-alive.

              These  values  may  change in the future. They are provided only
              for human consumption.

       status : sec_since_connect: optional string, containing an integer, at
       least 0
              The amount of time since this client last successfully connected
              to the database (in seconds). Value is empty if client has never
              successfully been connected.

       status : sec_since_disconnect: optional string, containing an integer,
       at least 0
              The amount of time since this client last disconnected from  the
              database  (in  seconds). Value is empty if client has never dis‚Äê
              connected.

       status : locks_held: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that  the  con‚Äê
              nection  holds.  Omitted  if  the  connection  does not hold any
              locks.

       status : locks_waiting: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that  the  con‚Äê
              nection  is currently waiting to acquire. Omitted if the connec‚Äê
              tion is not waiting for any locks.

       status : locks_lost: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that  the  con‚Äê
              nection  has  had  stolen by another OVSDB client. Omitted if no
              locks have been stolen from this connection.

       status : n_connections: optional string, containing an integer, at
       least 2
              When target specifies a connection method that listens  for  in‚Äê
              bound  connections  (e.g. ptcp: or pssl:) and more than one con‚Äê
              nection is actually active, the value is the  number  of  active
              connections. Otherwise, this key-value pair is omitted.

       status : bound_port: optional string, containing an integer
              When target is ptcp: or pssl:, this is the TCP port on which the
              OVSDB  server  is  listening.  (This is particularly useful when
              target specifies a port of 0, allowing the kernel to choose  any
              available port.)

   Details:
       records: map of string-string pairs
              Key-value pair of DNS records with DNS query name as the key and
              value as a string of IP address(es) separated by comma or space.
              For  PTR  requests,  the  key-value pair can be Reverse IPv4 ad‚Ä‚Äê
              dress.in-addr.arpa and the value DNS domain name. For  IPv6  ad‚Äê
              dresses, the key has to be Reverse IPv6 address.ip6.arpa.

              Example:  "vm1.ovn.org" = "10.0.0.4 aef0::4"

              Example:  "4.0.0.10.in-addr.arpa" = "vm1.ovn.org"

       options : ovn-owned: optional string
              If  set  to  true, then the OVN will be the main responsible for
              DNS Records within this row.

              A DNS row with this option set to true can be  created  for  do‚Äê

       Common Columns:
         external_ids                map of string-string pairs

   Details:
       private_key: string
              Name of a PEM file  containing  the  private  key  used  as  the
              switch‚Äôs identity for SSL/TLS connections to the controller.

       certificate: string
              Name  of a PEM file containing a certificate, signed by the cer‚Äê
              tificate authority (CA) used by the controller and manager, that
              certifies the switch‚Äôs private key,  identifying  a  trustworthy
              switch.

       ca_cert: string
              Name  of a PEM file containing the CA certificate used to verify
              that the switch is connected to a trustworthy controller.

       bootstrap_ca_cert: boolean
              If set to true, then Open vSwitch will attempt to obtain the  CA
              certificate  from the controller on its first SSL/TLS connection
              and save it to the named PEM file. If it is successful, it  will
              immediately  drop the connection and reconnect, and from then on
              all SSL/TLS connections must be authenticated by  a  certificate
              signed  by the CA certificate thus obtained. This option exposes
              the SSL/TLS connection to a man-in-the-middle  attack  obtaining
              the  initial  CA  certificate.  It may still be useful for boot‚Äê
              strapping.

       ssl_protocols: string
              Range or a comma- or space-delimited list of the SSL/TLS  proto‚Äê
              cols to enable for SSL/TLS connections.

              Supported  protocols  include TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3. Ranges can be
              provided in a form of two protocol names separated with  a  dash
              (TLSv1.2-TLSv1.3), or as a single protocol name with a plus sign
              (TLSv1.2+).  The value can be a list of protocols or exactly one
              range. The range is a preferred way of specifying protocols  and
              the  configuration  always  behaves  as if the range between the
              minimum and the maximum specified version is provided, i.e.,  if
              the  value  is  set to TLSv1.X,TLSv1.(X+2), the TLSv1.(X+1) will
              also be enabled as if it was a range. Regardless of  order,  the
              highest  protocol  supported  by  both sides will be chosen when
              making the connection.

              The default when this option is omitted is TLSv1.2+.

       ssl_ciphers: string
              List of ciphers (in OpenSSL cipher string  format)  to  be  sup‚Äê
              ported  for  SSL/TLS  connections with TLSv1.2. The default when
              this option is omitted is DEFAULT:@SECLEVEL=2.

       ssl_ciphersuites: string
              List of ciphersuites (in OpenSSL ciphersuites string format)  to
              be supported for SSL/TLS connections with TLSv1.3 and later. De‚Äê
              fault  value from OpenSSL will be used when this option is omit‚Äê
              ted.

HA_Chassis_Group TABLE
       Table representing a group of chassis which can provide high availabil‚Äê
       ity  services.  Each  chassis  in the group is represented by the table
       HA_Chassis. The HA chassis with highest priority  will  be  the  active
       chassis  of this group. If the active chassis failover is detected, the
       HA chassis with the next higher priority takes over the  responsibility
       of  providing the HA. If a distributed gateway router port references a
       row in this table, then the active HA chassis in  this  group  provides
       the gateway functionality.

BFD TABLE
       Contains BFD parameter for ovn-controller BFD  configuration.  OVN  BFD
       implementation is used to provide detection of failures in the path be‚Äê
       tween  adjacent  forwarding  engines, including the OVN interfaces. OVN
       BFD provides link status info to OVN northd in order to update  logical
       flows  according  to the status of BFD endpoints. In the current imple‚Äê
       mentation OVN BFD is used to check next-hop  status  for  ECMP  routes.
       Please  note  BFD table refers to OVN BFD implementation and not to OVS
       legacy one.

   Summary:
       Configuration:

              This is the minimum interval, in milliseconds,  that  the  local
              system  would like to use when transmitting BFD Control packets,
              less any jitter applied. The value  zero  is  reserved.  Default
              value is 1000 ms.

       min_rx: optional integer
              This  is the minimum interval, in milliseconds, between received
              BFD Control packets that this system is capable  of  supporting,
              less  any  jitter  applied by the sender. If this value is zero,
              the transmitting system does not want the remote system to  send
              any periodic BFD Control packets.

       detect_mult: optional integer, at least 1
              Detection  time  multiplier.  The  negotiated transmit interval,
              multiplied by this value, provides the Detection  Time  for  the

Chassis_Template_Var TABLE
       One record per chassis, each containing a map, variables, between  tem‚Äê
       plate  variable names and their value for that specific chassis. A tem‚Äê
       plate variable has a name and potentially different values on different
       hypervisors in the OVN cluster. For example, two  rows,  R1  =  (.chas‚Ä‚Äê
       sis=C1,  variables={(N: V1)} and R2 = (.chassis=C2, variables={(N: V2)}
       will make ovn-controller running on chassis C1 and C2 interpret the to‚Äê
       ken N either as V1 (on C1) or as V2 (on C2). Users can  refer  to  tem‚Äê
       plate variables from within other logical components, e.g., within ACL,
       QoS  or  Logical_Router_Policy  matches  or  from Load_Balancer VIP and
       backend definitions.

       If a template variable is referenced on a chassis for which that  vari‚Äê
       able  is  not  defined then ovn-controller running on that chassis will
       just interpret it as a raw string literal.

Network_Function TABLE
       Each  row  represents one network function entity. This contains a pair
       of logical_switch_ports. Traffic that matches the ACL is redirected  to
       inport  for  from-lport ACLs and to outport for to-lport ACLs. Once the
       traffic is received on the other port, it continues through  the  stan‚Äê
       dard  OVN  pipeline.  Response  traffic follows the reverse path: it is
       redirected to the outport for from-lport ACLs and to the inport for to-
       lport ACLs. Once the traffic is received  on  the  other  port,  it  is
       processed  by  the  regular OVN pipeline. NOTE: 1. The Network Function
       MUST NOT modify the packet headers. 2. The Network Function is not sup‚Äê
       ported when used in conjunction with Load Balancer.
