ovn-nbctl \- Open Virtual Network northbound db management utility
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBovn\-nbctl\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIcommand\fR [\fIarg\fR\[char46]\[char46]\[char46]]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
.PP
The \fBovn\-nbctl\fR program configures the \fBOVN_Northbound\fR database by providing a high-level interface to its configuration database\[char46] See \fBovn\-nb\fR(5) for comprehensive documentation of the database schema\[char46]
.PP
.PP
\fBovn\-nbctl\fR connects to an \fBovsdb\-server\fR process that maintains an OVN_Northbound configuration database\[char46] Using this connection, it queries and possibly applies changes to the database, depending on the supplied commands\[char46]
.PP
.PP
\fBovn\-nbctl\fR can perform any number of commands in a single run, implemented as a single atomic transaction against the database\[char46]
.PP
.PP
The \fBovn\-nbctl\fR command line begins with global options (see \fBOPTIONS\fR below for details)\[char46] The global options are followed by one or more commands\[char46] Each command should begin with \fB\-\-\fR by itself as a command-line argument, to separate it from the following commands\[char46] (The \fB\-\-\fR before the first command is optional\[char46]) The command itself starts with command-specific options, if any, followed by the command name and any arguments\[char46]
.SH "DAEMON MODE"
.PP
.PP
When it is invoked in the most ordinary way, \fBovn\-nbctl\fR connects to an OVSDB server that hosts the northbound database, retrieves a partial copy of the database that is complete enough to do its work, sends a transaction request to the server, and receives and processes the server\(cqs reply\[char46] In common interactive use, this is fine, but if the database is large, the step in which \fBovn\-nbctl\fR retrieves a partial copy of the database can take a long time, which yields poor performance overall\[char46]
.PP
.PP
To improve performance in such a case, \fBovn\-nbctl\fR offers a \(dqdaemon mode,\(dq in which the user first starts \fBovn\-nbctl\fR running in the background and afterward uses the daemon to execute operations\[char46] Over several \fBovn\-nbctl\fR command invocations, this performs better overall because it retrieves a copy of the database only once at the beginning, not once per program run\[char46]
.PP
.PP
Use the \fB\-\-detach\fR option to start an \fBovn\-nbctl\fR daemon\[char46] With this option, \fBovn\-nbctl\fR prints the name of a control socket to stdout\[char46] The client should save this name in environment variable \fBOVN_NB_DAEMON\fR\[char46] Under the Bourne shell this might be done like this:
.PP
.nf
\fL
.br
\fL      export OVN_NB_DAEMON=$(ovn\-nbctl \-\-pidfile \-\-detach)
.br
\fL    \fR
.fi
.PP
.PP
When \fBOVN_NB_DAEMON\fR is set, \fBovn\-nbctl\fR automatically and transparently uses the daemon to execute its commands\[char46]
.PP
.PP
When the daemon is no longer needed, kill it and unset the environment variable, e\[char46]g\[char46]:
.PP
.nf
\fL
.br
\fL      kill $(cat $OVN_RUNDIR/ovn\-nbctl\[char46]pid)
.br
\fL      unset OVN_NB_DAEMON
.br
\fL    \fR
.fi
.PP
.PP
When using daemon mode, an alternative to the \fBOVN_NB_DAEMON\fR environment variable is to specify a path for the Unix socket\[char46] When starting the ovn-nbctl daemon, specify the \fB\-u\fR option with a full path to the location of the socket file\[char46] Here is an exmple:
.PP
.nf
\fL
.br
\fL      ovn\-nbctl \-\-detach \-u /tmp/mysock\[char46]ctl
.br
\fL    \fR
.fi
.PP
.PP
Then to connect to the running daemon, use the \fB\-u\fR option with the full path to the socket created when the daemon was started:
.PP
.nf
\fL
.br
\fL      ovn\-nbctl \-u /tmp/mysock\[char46]ctl show
.br
\fL    \fR
.fi
.ST "Daemon Commands"
.PP
.PP
Daemon mode is internally implemented using the same mechanism used by \fBovn\-appctl\fR\[char46] One may also use \fBovn\-appctl\fR directly with the following commands:
.RS
.TP
\fBrun\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIcommand\fR [\fIarg\fR\[char46]\[char46]\[char46]] [\fB\-\-\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIcommand\fR [\fIarg\fR\[char46]\[char46]\[char46]] \[char46]\[char46]\[char46]]
Instructs the daemon process to run one or more \fBovn\-nbctl\fR commands described above and reply with the results of running these commands\[char46] Accepts the \fB\-\-no\-wait\fR, \fB\-\-wait\fR, \fB\-\-timeout\fR, \fB\-\-dry\-run\fR, \fB\-\-oneline\fR, and the options described under \fBTable Formatting Options\fR in addition to the the command-specific options\[char46]
.TP
\fBexit\fR
Causes \fBovn\-nbctl\fR to gracefully terminate\[char46]
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
.PP
The options listed below affect the behavior of \fBovn\-nbctl\fR as a whole\[char46] Some individual commands also accept their own options, which are given just before the command name\[char46] If the first command on the command line has options, then those options must be separated from the global options by \fB\-\-\fR\[char46]
.PP
.PP
\fBovn\-nbctl\fR also accepts options from the \fBOVN_NBCTL_OPTIONS\fR environment variable, in the same format as on the command line\[char46] Options from the command line override those in the environment\[char46]
.RS
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-wait\fR | \fB\-\-wait=none\fR
.TQ .5in
\fB\-\-wait=sb\fR
.TQ .5in
\fB\-\-wait=hv\fR
These options control whether and how \fBovn\-nbctl\fR waits for the OVN system to become up-to-date with changes made in an \fBovn\-nbctl\fR invocation\[char46]
.IP
By default, or if \fB\-\-no\-wait\fR or \fB\-\-wait=none\fR, \fBovn\-nbctl\fR exits immediately after confirming that changes have been committed to the northbound database, without waiting\[char46]
.IP
With \fB\-\-wait=sb\fR, before \fBovn\-nbctl\fR exits, it waits for \fBovn\-northd\fR to bring the southbound database up-to-date with the northbound database updates\[char46]
.IP
With \fB\-\-wait=hv\fR, before \fBovn\-nbctl\fR exits, it additionally waits for all OVN chassis (hypervisors and gateways) to become up-to-date with the northbound database updates\[char46] (This can become an indefinite wait if any chassis is malfunctioning\[char46])
.IP
Ordinarily, \fB\-\-wait=sb\fR or \fB\-\-wait=hv\fR only waits for changes by the current \fBovn\-nbctl\fR invocation to take effect\[char46] This means that, if none of the commands supplied to \fBovn\-nbctl\fR change the database, then the command does not wait at all\[char46] Use the \fBsync\fR command to override this behavior\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-\-db\fR \fIdatabase\fR
The OVSDB database remote to contact\[char46] If the \fBOVN_NB_DB\fR environment variable is set, its value is used as the default\[char46] Otherwise, the default is \fBunix:/ovnnb_db\[char46]sock\fR, but this default is unlikely to be useful outside of single-machine OVN test environments\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-\-leader\-only\fR
.TQ .5in
\fB\-\-no\-leader\-only\fR
By default, or with \fB\-\-leader\-only\fR, when the database server is a clustered database, \fBovn\-nbctl\fR will avoid servers other than the cluster leader\[char46] This ensures that any data that \fBovn\-nbctl\fR reads and reports is up-to-date\[char46] With \fB\-\-no\-leader\-only\fR, \fBovn\-nbctl\fR will use any server in the cluster, which means that for read-only transactions it can report and act on stale data (transactions that modify the database are always serialized even with \fB\-\-no\-leader\-only\fR)\[char46] Refer to \fBUnderstanding Cluster Consistency\fR in \fBovsdb\fR(7) for more information\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-\-shuffle\-remotes\fR
.TQ .5in
\fB\-\-no\-shuffle\-remotes\fR
By default, or with \fB\-\-shuffle\-remotes\fR, when there are multiple remotes specified in the OVSDB connection string specified by \fB\-\-db\fR or the \fBOVN_NB_DB\fR environment variable, the order of the remotes will be shuffled before the client tries to connect\[char46] The remotes will be shuffled only once to a new order before the first connection attempt\[char46] The following retries, if any, will follow the same new order\[char46] The default behavior is to make sure clients of a clustered database can distribute evenly to all memembers of the cluster\[char46] With \fB\-\-no\-shuffle\-remotes\fR, \fBovn\-nbctl\fR will use the original order specified in the connection string to connect\[char46] This allows user to specify the preferred order, which is particularly useful for testing\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-syslog\fR
By default, \fBovn\-nbctl\fR logs its arguments and the details of any changes that it makes to the system log\[char46] This option disables this logging\[char46]
.IP
This option is equivalent to \fB\-\-verbose=nbctl:syslog:warn\fR\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-\-oneline\fR
Modifies the output format so that the output for each command is printed on a single line\[char46] New-line characters that would otherwise separate lines are printed as \efB\e\en\efR, and any instances of \efB\e\e\efR that would otherwise appear in the output are doubled\[char46] Prints a blank line for each command that has no output\[char46] This option does not affect the formatting of output from the \fBlist\fR or \fBfind\fR commands; see \fBTable Formatting Options\fR below\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR
Prevents \fBovn\-nbctl\fR from actually modifying the database\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-t \fIsecs\fB\fR
.TQ .5in
\fB\-\-timeout=\fIsecs\fB\fR
By default, or with a \fIsecs\fR of \fB0\fR, \fBovn\-nbctl\fR waits forever for a response from the database\[char46] This option limits runtime to approximately \fIsecs\fR seconds\[char46] If the timeout expires, \fBovn\-nbctl\fR will exit with a \fBSIGALRM\fR signal\[char46] (A timeout would normally happen only if the database cannot be contacted, or if the system is overloaded\[char46])
.TP
\fB\-\-print\-wait\-time\fR
When \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, the option \fB\-\-print\-wait\-time\fR can be used to print the time spent on waiting, depending on the value specified in \fB \-\-wait\fR option\[char46] If \fB\-\-wait=sb\fR is specified, it prints \(dqovn-northd delay before processing\(dq, which is the time between the Northbound DB update by the command and the moment when \fB ovn\-northd\fR starts processing the update, and \(dqovn-northd completion\(dq, which is the time between the Northbound DB update and the moment when \fBovn\-northd\fR completes the Southbound DB updating successfully\[char46] If \fB\-\-wait=hv\fR is specified, in addition to the above information, it also prints \(dqovn-controller(s) completion\(dq, which is the time between the Northbound DB update and the moment when the slowest hypervisor finishes processing the update\[char46]
.RE
.SS "Daemon Options"
.TP
\fB\-\-pidfile\fR[\fB=\fR\fIpidfile\fR]
Causes a file (by default, \fB\fIprogram\fB\[char46]pid\fR) to be created indicating the PID of the running process\[char46] If the \fIpidfile\fR argument is not specified, or if it does not begin with \fB/\fR, then it is created in \fB\fR\[char46]
.IP
If \fB\-\-pidfile\fR is not specified, no pidfile is created\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-\-overwrite\-pidfile\fR
By default, when \fB\-\-pidfile\fR is specified and the specified pidfile already exists and is locked by a running process, the daemon refuses to start\[char46] Specify \fB\-\-overwrite\-pidfile\fR to cause it to instead overwrite the pidfile\[char46]
.IP
When \fB\-\-pidfile\fR is not specified, this option has no effect\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-\-detach\fR
Runs this program as a background process\[char46] The process forks, and in the child it starts a new session, closes the standard file descriptors (which has the side effect of disabling logging to the console), and changes its current directory to the root (unless \fB\-\-no\-chdir\fR is specified)\[char46] After the child completes its initialization, the parent exits\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-\-monitor\fR
Creates an additional process to monitor this program\[char46] If it dies due to a signal that indicates a programming error (\fBSIGABRT\fR, \fBSIGALRM\fR, \fBSIGBUS\fR, \fBSIGFPE\fR, \fBSIGILL\fR, \fBSIGPIPE\fR, \fBSIGSEGV\fR, \fBSIGXCPU\fR, or \fBSIGXFSZ\fR) then the monitor process starts a new copy of it\[char46] If the daemon dies or exits for another reason, the monitor process exits\[char46]
.IP
This option is normally used with \fB\-\-detach\fR, but it also functions without it\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-chdir\fR
By default, when \fB\-\-detach\fR is specified, the daemon changes its current working directory to the root directory after it detaches\[char46] Otherwise, invoking the daemon from a carelessly chosen directory would prevent the administrator from unmounting the file system that holds that directory\[char46]
.IP
Specifying \fB\-\-no\-chdir\fR suppresses this behavior, preventing the daemon from changing its current working directory\[char46] This may be useful for collecting core files, since it is common behavior to write core dumps into the current working directory and the root directory is not a good directory to use\[char46]
.IP
This option has no effect when \fB\-\-detach\fR is not specified\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-self\-confinement\fR
By default this daemon will try to self-confine itself to work with files under well-known directories determined at build time\[char46] It is better to stick with this default behavior and not to use this flag unless some other Access Control is used to confine daemon\[char46] Note that in contrast to other access control implementations that are typically enforced from kernel-space (e\[char46]g\[char46] DAC or MAC), self-confinement is imposed from the user-space daemon itself and hence should not be considered as a full confinement strategy, but instead should be viewed as an additional layer of security\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-\-user=\fR\fIuser\fR\fB:\fR\fIgroup\fR
Causes this program to run as a different user specified in \fIuser\fR\fB:\fR\fIgroup\fR, thus dropping most of the root privileges\[char46] Short forms \fIuser\fR and \fB:\fR\fIgroup\fR are also allowed, with current user or group assumed, respectively\[char46] Only daemons started by the root user accepts this argument\[char46]
.IP
On Linux, daemons will be granted \fBCAP_IPC_LOCK\fR and \fBCAP_NET_BIND_SERVICES\fR before dropping root privileges\[char46] Daemons that interact with a datapath, such as \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR, will be granted three additional capabilities, namely \fBCAP_NET_ADMIN\fR, \fBCAP_NET_BROADCAST\fR and \fBCAP_NET_RAW\fR\[char46] The capability change will apply even if the new user is root\[char46]
.IP
On Windows, this option is not currently supported\[char46] For security reasons, specifying this option will cause the daemon process not to start\[char46]

.IP
On Windows platform, \fBsyslog\fR is accepted as a word and is only useful along with the \fB\-\-syslog\-target\fR option (the word has no effect otherwise)\[char46]
.IP \(bu
\fBoff\fR, \fBemer\fR, \fBerr\fR, \fBwarn\fR, \fBinfo\fR, or \fBdbg\fR, to control the log level\[char46] Messages of the given severity or higher will be logged, and messages of lower severity will be filtered out\[char46] \fBoff\fR filters out all messages\[char46] See \fBovs\-appctl\fR(8) for a definition of each log level\[char46]

\fBinit\fR
Initializes the database, if it is empty\[char46] If the database has already been initialized, this command has no effect\[char46]
.TP
\fBshow [\fIswitch\fB | \fIrouter\fB]\fR
Prints a brief overview of the database contents\[char46] If \fIswitch\fR is provided, only records related to that logical switch are shown\[char46] If \fIrouter\fR is provided, only records related to that logical router are shown\[char46]
.SS "Logical Switch Commands"
.TP
\fBls\-add\fR
Creates a new, unnamed logical switch, which initially has no ports\[char46] The switch does not have a name, other commands must refer to this switch by its UUID\[char46]
.TP
[\fB\-\-may\-exist\fR | \fB\-\-add\-duplicate\fR] \fBls\-add\fR \fIswitch\fR
Creates a new logical switch named \fIswitch\fR, which initially has no ports\[char46]
.IP
The OVN northbound database schema does not require logical switch names to be unique, but the whole point to the names is to provide an easy way for humans to refer to the switches, making duplicate names unhelpful\[char46] Thus, without any options, this command regards it as an error if \fIswitch\fR is a duplicate name\[char46] With \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, adding a duplicate name succeeds but does not create a new logical switch\[char46] With \fB\-\-add\-duplicate\fR, the command really creates a new logical switch with a duplicate name\[char46] It is an error to specify both options\[char46] If there are multiple logical switches with a duplicate name, configure the logical switches using the UUID instead of the \fIswitch\fR name\[char46]
.TP

Without \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, it is an error if \fIrecord\fR does not exist or \fIkey\fR is specified, if \fIkey\fR does not exist in \fIrecord\fR\[char46] With \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, a missing \fIrecord\fR yields no output and a missing \fIkey\fR prints a blank line\[char46]

[\fB\-\-if\-exists\fR] \fBadd\fR \fItable record column\fR [\fIkey\fR\fB=\fR]\fIvalue\fR\[char46]\[char46]\[char46]
Adds the specified value or key-value pair to \fIcolumn\fR in \fIrecord\fR in \fItable\fR\[char46] If \fIcolumn\fR is a map, then \fIkey\fR is required, otherwise it is prohibited\[char46] If \fIkey\fR already exists in a map column, then the current \fIvalue\fR is not replaced (use the \fBset\fR command to replace an existing value)\[char46]

Removes the specified values or key-value pairs from \fIcolumn\fR in \fIrecord\fR in \fItable\fR\[char46] The first form applies to columns that are not maps: each specified \fIvalue\fR is removed from the column\[char46] The second and third forms apply to map columns: if only a \fIkey\fR is specified, then any key-value pair with the given \fIkey\fR is removed, regardless of its value; if a \fIvalue\fR is given then a pair is removed only if both key and value match\[char46]

Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)
Records in the Open vSwitch database are significant only when they can be reached directly or indirectly from the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table\[char46] Except for records in the \fBQoS\fR or \fBQueue\fR tables, records that are not reachable from the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table are automatically deleted from the database\[char46] This deletion happens immediately, without waiting for additional \fBovs\-vsctl\fR commands or other database activity\[char46] Thus, a \fBcreate\fR command must generally be accompanied by additional commands \fIwithin the same\fR \fBovs\-vsctl\fR \fIinvocation\fR to add a chain of references to the newly created record from the top-level \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR record\[char46] The \fBEXAMPLES\fR section gives some examples that show how to do this\[char46]

Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)
The \fBdestroy\fR command is only useful for records in the \fBQoS\fR or \fBQueue\fR tables\[char46] Records in other tables are automatically deleted from the database when they become unreachable from the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table\[char46] This means that deleting the last reference to a record is sufficient for deleting the record itself\[char46] For records in these tables, \fBdestroy\fR is silently ignored\[char46] See the \fBEXAMPLES\fR section below for more information\[char46]

\fBwait\-until\fR \fItable record\fR [\fIcolumn\fR[\fB:\fR\fIkey\fR]\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR]\[char46]\[char46]\[char46]
Waits until \fItable\fR contains a record named \fIrecord\fR whose \fIcolumn\fR equals \fIvalue\fR or, if \fIkey\fR is specified, whose \fIcolumn\fR contains a \fIkey\fR with the specified \fIvalue\fR\[char46] This command supports the same operators and semantics described for the \fBfind\fR command above\[char46]
.IP
If no \fIcolumn\fR[\fB:\fR\fIkey\fR]\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR arguments are given, this command waits only until \fIrecord\fR exists\[char46] If more than one such argument is given, the command waits until all of them are satisfied\[char46]

Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)
Usually \fBwait\-until\fR should be placed at the beginning of a set of \fBovs\-vsctl\fR commands\[char46] For example, \fBwait\-until bridge br0
\-\- get bridge br0 datapath_id\fR waits until a bridge named \fBbr0\fR is created, then prints its \fBdatapath_id\fR column, whereas \fBget bridge br0 datapath_id \-\- wait\-until bridge br0\fR will abort if no bridge named \fBbr0\fR exists when \fBovs\-vsctl\fR initially connects to the database\[char46]
