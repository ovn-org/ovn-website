NAME
       ovn-ic-nb - OVN_IC_Northbound database schema

       This  database is the interface for cloud management system (CMS), such
       as OpenStack, to configure OVN interconnection settings. The  CMS  pro‐
       duces  almost  all  of the contents of the database. The ovn-ic program
       monitors the database contents, transforms it, and stores it  into  the
       OVN_IC_Southbound database.

       We  generally  speak  of  ``the’’ CMS, but one can imagine scenarios in
       which multiple CMSes manage different parts of OVN interconnection.

   External IDs
       Each of the tables in this database contains a  special  column,  named
       external_ids.  This  column has the same form and purpose each place it
       appears.

              external_ids: map of string-string pairs
                     Key-value pairs for use by the CMS.  The  CMS  might  use
                     certain  pairs,  for example, to identify entities in its
                     own configuration that correspond to those in this  data‐
                     base.

       Common Columns:
         external_ids                map of string-string pairs

   Details:
       private_key: string
              Name  of  a  PEM  file  containing  the  private key used as the
              switch’s identity for SSL connections to the controller.

       certificate: string
              Name of a PEM file containing a certificate, signed by the  cer‐
              tificate authority (CA) used by the controller and manager, that
              certifies the switch’s private key,  identifying  a  trustworthy
              switch.

       ca_cert: string
              Name  of a PEM file containing the CA certificate used to verify
              that the switch is connected to a trustworthy controller.

       bootstrap_ca_cert: boolean
              If set to true, then Open vSwitch will attempt to obtain the  CA
              certificate  from the controller on its first SSL connection and
              save it to the named PEM file. If  it  is  successful,  it  will
              immediately  drop the connection and reconnect, and from then on
              all SSL connections  must  be  authenticated  by  a  certificate
              signed  by the CA certificate thus obtained. This option exposes
              the SSL connection to a man-in-the-middle attack  obtaining  the
              initial  CA  certificate.  It may still be useful for bootstrap‐
              ping.

       ssl_protocols: string
              List of SSL protocols to be enabled  for  SSL  connections.  The
              default when this option is omitted is TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2.

       ssl_ciphers: string
              List  of  ciphers  (in  OpenSSL cipher string format) to be sup‐
              ported for SSL connections. The  default  when  this  option  is
              omitted is HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5.

       external_ids: map of string-string pairs

Connection TABLE
       Configuration for a database connection to  an  Open  vSwitch  database
       (OVSDB) client.

       This  table  primarily  configures  the  Open  vSwitch  database server
       (ovsdb-server).

       The Open vSwitch database server can initiate and maintain active  con‐
       nections  to  remote  clients.  It can also listen for database connec‐
       tions.

     Core Features:

       target: string (must be unique within table)
              Connection methods for clients.

              The following connection methods are currently supported:

              ssl:host[:port]
                     The specified SSL port on the host  at  the  given  host,
                     which  can  either  be  a DNS name (if built with unbound
                     library) or an IP address. A valid SSL configuration must
                     be  provided  when  this form is used, this configuration
                     can be specified via command-line options or the SSL  ta‐
                     ble.

                     If port is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

                     SSL  support  is  an  optional feature that is not always
                     built as part of Open vSwitch.

              tcp:host[:port]
                     The specified TCP port on the host  at  the  given  host,
                     which  can  either  be  a DNS name (if built with unbound
                     library) or an IP address. If host is  an  IPv6  address,
                     wrap it in square brackets, e.g. tcp:[::1]:6640.

                     If port is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

              pssl:[port][:host]
                     Listens  for  SSL  connections on the specified TCP port.
                     Specify 0 for  port  to  have  the  kernel  automatically
                     choose  an available port. If host, which can either be a
                     DNS name  (if  built  with  unbound  library)  or  an  IP
                     address, is specified, then connections are restricted to
                     the resolved or specified local IPaddress (either IPv4 or
                     IPv6 address). If host is an IPv6 address, wrap in square
                     brackets, e.g. pssl:6640:[::1]. If host is not  specified
                     then  it listens only on IPv4 (but not IPv6) addresses. A
                     valid SSL configuration must be provided when  this  form
                     is  used,  this  can be specified either via command-line
                     options or the SSL table.

                     If port is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

                     SSL support is an optional feature  that  is  not  always
                     built as part of Open vSwitch.

              ptcp:[port][:host]
                     Listens  for connections on the specified TCP port. Spec‐
                     ify 0 for port to have the kernel automatically choose an
                     available  port.  If host, which can either be a DNS name
                     (if built with unbound library)  or  an  IP  address,  is
                     specified,   then   connections  are  restricted  to  the
                     resolved or specified local IP address  (either  IPv4  or
                     IPv6  address).  If  host  is an IPv6 address, wrap it in
                     square brackets, e.g. ptcp:6640:[::1].  If  host  is  not
                     specified then it listens only on IPv4 addresses.

                     If port is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

              When  multiple clients are configured, the target values must be
              unique. Duplicate target values yield unspecified results.

     Client Failure Detection and Handling:

       max_backoff: optional integer, at least 1,000
              Maximum  number  of  milliseconds  to  wait  between  connection
              attempts. Default is implementation-specific.

       inactivity_probe: optional integer
              Maximum number of milliseconds of idle time on connection to the
              client before sending  an  inactivity  probe  message.  If  Open
              vSwitch  does  not communicate with the client for the specified
              number of seconds, it will send a probe. If a  response  is  not
              received  for  the  same additional amount of time, Open vSwitch
              assumes the connection has been broken and  attempts  to  recon‐
              nect.  Default is implementation-specific. A value of 0 disables
              inactivity probes.

     Status:

       Key-value pair of is_connected is always updated. Other key-value pairs
       in the status columns may be updated depends on the target type.

       When target specifies a connection method that listens for inbound con‐
       nections (e.g. ptcp: or punix:), both  n_connections  and  is_connected
       may also be updated while the remaining key-value pairs are omitted.

       On  the  other  hand, when target specifies an outbound connection, all
       key-value pairs may be updated, except  the  above-mentioned  two  key-
       value  pairs associated with inbound connection targets. They are omit‐
       ted.

       is_connected: boolean
              true if currently connected to this client, false otherwise.

       status : last_error: optional string
              A human-readable description of the last error on the connection
              to  the  manager; i.e. strerror(errno). This key will exist only
              if an error has occurred.

       status : state: optional string, one of  ACTIVE,  BACKOFF,  CONNECTING,
       IDLE, or VOID
              The state of the connection to the manager:

              VOID   Connection is disabled.

              BACKOFF
                     Attempting to reconnect at an increasing period.

              CONNECTING
                     Attempting to connect.

              ACTIVE Connected, remote host responsive.

              IDLE   Connection is idle. Waiting for response to keep-alive.

              These  values  may  change in the future. They are provided only
              for human consumption.

       status : sec_since_connect: optional string, containing an integer,  at
       least 0
              The amount of time since this client last successfully connected
              to the database (in seconds). Value is empty if client has never
              successfully been connected.

       status  : sec_since_disconnect: optional string, containing an integer,
       at least 0
              The amount of time since this client last disconnected from  the
              database  (in  seconds). Value is empty if client has never dis‐
              connected.

       status : locks_held: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that  the  con‐
              nection  holds.  Omitted  if  the  connection  does not hold any
              locks.

       status : locks_waiting: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that  the  con‐
              nection  is currently waiting to acquire. Omitted if the connec‐
              tion is not waiting for any locks.

       status : locks_lost: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that  the  con‐
              nection  has  had  stolen by another OVSDB client. Omitted if no
              locks have been stolen from this connection.

       status : n_connections: optional  string,  containing  an  integer,  at
       least 2
              When  target  specifies  a  connection  method  that listens for
              inbound connections (e.g. ptcp: or pssl:) and more than one con‐
              nection  is  actually  active, the value is the number of active
              connections. Otherwise, this key-value pair is omitted.

       status : bound_port: optional string, containing an integer
              When target is ptcp: or pssl:, this is the TCP port on which the
              OVSDB  server  is  listening.  (This is particularly useful when
              target specifies a port of 0, allowing the kernel to choose  any
              available port.)
