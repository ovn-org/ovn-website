ovn-appctl(8)                     OVN Manual                     ovn-appctl(8)

NAME
       ovn-appctl - utility for configuring running OVN daemons

SYNOPSIS
        ovn-appctl [-target=target | -t target] [-T secs | -timeout=secs] com‚Äê
       mand [arg...]

       ovn-appctl -help

       ovn-appctl -version

DESCRIPTION
       OVN  daemons accept certain commands at runtime to control their behav‚Äê
       ior and query their settings. Every daemon accepts a common set of com‚Äê
       mands documented under COMMON COMMANDS below. Some daemons support  ad‚Äê
       ditional commands documented in their own manpages.

       The  ovn-appctl program provides a simple way to invoke these commands.
       The command to be sent is specified on  ovn-appctl‚Ä‚Äôs  command  line  as
       non-option  arguments. ovn-appctl sends the command and prints the dae‚Äê
       mon‚Äôs response on standard output.

       ovn-appctl is the equivalent of the Open vSwitch ovs-appctl utility.

COMMAND COMMANDS
       Every OVN daemon supports a common set of  commands,  which  are  docu‚Äê
       mented in this section.

   General Commands
       These  commands  display  daemon-specific commands and the running ver‚Äê
       sion. Note that these commands are different from the -help  and  -ver‚Äê
       sion  options  that return information about the ovn-appctl utility it‚Äê
       self.

              list-commands
                     Lists the commands supported by the target.

              version
                     Displays the version and compilation date of the target.

   Logging Commands
       OVN has several log levels. The highest-severity log level is:

              off    No message is ever logged at this  level,  so  setting  a
                     logging  destination‚Äôs  log level to off disables logging
                     to that destination.

       The following log levels, in order of descending severity,  are  avail‚Äê
       able:

              emer   A major failure forced a process to hard stop.

              err    A  high-level  operation or a subsystem failed. Attention
                     is warranted.

              warn   A low-level operation failed, but higher-level subsystems
                     may be able to recover.

              info   Information that may be useful in retrospect when  inves‚Äê
                     tigating a problem.

              dbg    Information  useful only to someone with intricate knowl‚Äê
                     edge of the system, or that would commonly cause  too-vo‚Äê
                     luminous  log  output. Log messages at this level are not
                     logged by default.

       Every OVN daemon supports the following commands for examining and  ad‚Äê
       justing log levels.

              vlog/list
                     Lists the known logging modules and their current levels.

              vlog/list-pattern
                     Lists logging pattern used for each destination.

              vlog/set [spec]
                     Sets logging levels. Without any spec, sets the log level
                     for  every module and destination to dbg. Otherwise, spec
                     is a list of words  separated  by  spaces  or  commas  or
                     colons, up to one from each category below:

                     ‚Ä¢      A valid module name, as displayed by the vlog/list
                            command  on  ovn-appctl(8),  limits  the log level
                            change to the specified module.

                     ‚Ä¢      syslog, console, or file, to limit the  log  level
                            change  to only to the system log, to the console,
                            or to a file, respectively.

                            On Windows platform, syslog is accepted as a  word
                            and  is only useful if the target was started with
                            the --syslog-target option (the word has no effect
                            otherwise).

                     ‚Ä¢      off, emer, err, warn, info, or dbg, to control the
                            log level.  Messages  of  the  given  severity  or
                            higher  will  be  logged,  and  messages  of lower
                            severity will be filtered out. off filters out all
                            messages.

                     Case is not significant within spec.

              vlog/set PATTERN:destination: pattern
                     Sets the log pattern for  destination  to  pattern.  Each
                     time  a  message is logged to destination, pattern deter‚Äê
                     mines the message‚Äôs formatting. Most characters  in  pat‚Äê
                     tern are copied literally to the log, but special escapes
                     beginning with % are expanded as follows:

                     ‚Ä¢      %A  : The name of the application logging the mes‚Äê
                            sage, e.g. ovn-controller.

                     ‚Ä¢      %B : The RFC5424 syslog PRI of the message.

                     ‚Ä¢      %c : The name of the module (as shown  by  ovn-ap‚Äê
                            pctl -list) logging the message.

                     ‚Ä¢      %d  : The current date and time in ISO 8601 format
                            (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).

                     ‚Ä¢      %d{format} : The current  date  and  time  in  the
                            specified  format,  which takes the same format as
                            the template argument to strftime(3). As an exten‚Äê
                            sion, any # characters in format will be  replaced
                            by  fractional  seconds, e.g. use %H:%M:%S.### for
                            the time to the  nearest  millisecond.  Sub-second
                            times  are  only approximate and currently decimal
                            places after the third will always be reported  as
                            zero.

                     ‚Ä¢      %D  :  The  current  UTC date and time in ISO 8601
                            format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).

                     ‚Ä¢      %D{format} : The current UTC date and time in  the
                            specified  format,  which takes the same format as
                            the template argument to strftime(3). Supports the
                            same  extension  for  sub-second   resolution   as
                            %d{...}.

                     ‚Ä¢      %E : The hostname of the node running the applica‚Äê
                            tion.

                     ‚Ä¢      %m : The message being logged.

                     ‚Ä¢      %N  : A serial number for this message within this
                            run of the program, as a decimal number. The first
                            message a program logs has serial  number  1,  the
                            second one has serial number 2, and so on.

                     ‚Ä¢      %n : A new-line.

                     ‚Ä¢      %p  :  The  level  at which the message is logged,
                            e.g. DBG.

                     ‚Ä¢      %P : The program‚Äôs process ID (pid), as a  decimal
                            number.

                     ‚Ä¢      %r  :  The number of milliseconds elapsed from the
                            start of the application to the time  the  message
                            was logged.

                     ‚Ä¢      %t  : The subprogram name, that is, an identifying
                            name for the process or thread  that  emitted  the
                            log  message, such as monitor for the process used
                            for -monitor or main for the  primary  process  or
                            thread in a program.

                     ‚Ä¢      %T  : The subprogram name enclosed in parentheses,
                            e.g. (monitor), or the empty string for  the  pri‚Äê
                            mary process or thread in a program.

                     ‚Ä¢      %% : A literal %.

                     A  few  options  may  appear between the % and the format
                     specifier character, in this order:

                     ‚Ä¢      - : Left justify the escape‚Äôs expansion within its
                            field width. Right justification is the default.

                     ‚Ä¢      - : Pad the field to  the  field  width  with  0s.
                            Padding with spaces is the default.

                     width  A number specifies the minimum field width. If the
                     escape expands to fewer characters than width then it  is
                     padded to fill the field width. (A field wider than width
                     is not truncated to fit.)

                     The  default  pattern  for  console  and  file  output is
                     %D{%Y-%m-%dT %H:%M:%SZ}|%05N|%c|%p|%m; for syslog output,
                     %05N|%c|%p|%m.

              vlog/set FACILITY:facility
                     Sets the RFC5424 facility of the  log  message.  facility
                     can  be  one  of  kern, user, mail, daemon, auth, syslog,
                     lpr, news, uucp, clock, ftp, ntp, audit,  alert,  clock2,
                     local0, local1, local2, local3, local4, local5, local6 or
                     local7.

              vlog/close
                     Causes  the  daemon to close its log file, if it is open.
                     (Use vlog/reopen to reopen it later.)

              vlog/reopen
                     Causes the daemon to close its log file, if it  is  open,
                     and  then  reopen  it. (This is useful after rotating log
                     files, to cause a new log file to be used.)

                     This has no effect if the target application was not  in‚Äê
                     voked with the --log-file option.

OPTIONS
       -h
       --help
            Prints a brief help message to the console.

       -V
       --version
            Prints version information to the console.
