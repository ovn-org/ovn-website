NAME
       ovn-appctl - utility for configuring running OVN daemons

SYNOPSIS
        ovn-appctl [-target=target | -t target] [-T secs | -timeout=secs] com‐
       mand [arg...]

       ovn-appctl -help

       ovn-appctl -version

DESCRIPTION
       OVN daemons accept certain commands at runtime to control their  behav‐
       ior and query their settings. Every daemon accepts a common set of com‐
       mands documented under COMMON  COMMANDS  below.  Some  daemons  support
       additional commands documented in their own manpages.

       The  ovn-appctl program provides a simple way to invoke these commands.
       The command to be sent is specified on  ovn-appctl’s  command  line  as
       non-option  arguments. ovn-appctl sends the command and prints the dae‐
       mon’s response on standard output.

       ovn-ctl is exactly similar to Open vSwitch ovs-appctl utility.

COMMAND COMMANDS
       Every OVN daemon supports a common set of  commands,  which  are  docu‐
       mented in this section.

   General Commands
       These  commands  display  daemon-specific commands and the running ver‐
       sion. Note that these commands are different from the -help  and  -ver‐
       sion  options  that  return  information  about  the ovn-appctl utility
       itself.

              list-commands
                     Lists the commands supported by the target.

              version
                     Displays the version and compilation date of the target.

   Logging Commands
       OVN has several log levels. The highest-severity log level is:

              off    No message is ever logged at this  level,  so  setting  a
                     logging  destination’s  log level to off disables logging
                     to that destination.

       The following log levels, in order of descending severity,  are  avail‐
       able:

              emer   A major failure forced a process to abort.

              err    A  high-level  operation or a subsystem failed. Attention
                     is warranted.

              warn   A low-level operation failed, but higher-level subsystems
                     may be able to recover.

              info   Information  that may be useful in retrospect when inves‐
                     tigating a problem.

              dbg    Information useful only to someone with intricate  knowl‐
                     edge  of  the  system,  or that would commonly cause too-
                     voluminous log output. Log messages at this level are not
                     logged by default.

       Every  OVN  daemon  supports  the  following commands for examining and
       adjusting log levels.

              vlog/list
                     Lists the known logging modules and their current levels.

              vlog/list-pattern
                     Lists logging pattern used for each destination.

              vlog/set [spec]
                     Sets logging levels. Without any spec, sets the log level
                     for  every module and destination to dbg. Otherwise, spec
                     is a list of words  separated  by  spaces  or  commas  or
                     colons, up to one from each category below:

                     ·      A valid module name, as displayed by the vlog/list
                            command on ovn-appctl(8),  limits  the  log  level
                            change to the specified module.

                     ·      syslog,  console,  or file, to limit the log level
                            change to only to the system log, to the  console,
                            or to a file, respectively.

                            On  Windows platform, syslog is accepted as a word
                            and is only useful if the target was started  with
                            the --syslog-target option (the word has no effect
                            otherwise).

                     ·      off, emer, err, warn, info, or dbg, to control the
                            log  level.  Messages  of  the  given  severity or
                            higher will  be  logged,  and  messages  of  lower
                            severity will be filtered out. off filters out all
                            messages.

                     Case is not significant within spec.

              vlog/set PATTERN:destination: pattern
                     Sets the log pattern for  destination  to  pattern.  Each
                     time  a  message is logged to destination, pattern deter‐
                     mines the message’s formatting. Most characters  in  pat‐
                     tern are copied literally to the log, but special escapes
                     beginning with % are expanded as follows:

                     ·      %A : The name of the application logging the  mes‐
                            sage, e.g. ovn-controller.

                     ·      %B : The RFC5424 syslog PRI of the message.

                     ·      %c  :  The  name  of  the module (as shown by ovn-
                            appctl -list) logging the message.

                     ·      %d : The current date and time in ISO 8601  format
                            (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).

                     ·      %d{format}  :  The  current  date  and time in the
                            specified format, which takes the same  format  as
                            the template argument to strftime(3). As an exten‐
                            sion, any # characters in format will be  replaced
                            by  fractional  seconds, e.g. use %H:%M:%S.### for
                            the time to the  nearest  millisecond.  Sub-second
                            times  are  only approximate and currently decimal
                            places after the third will always be reported  as
                            zero.

                     ·      %D  :  The  current  UTC date and time in ISO 8601
                            format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).

                     ·      %D{format} : The current UTC date and time in  the
                            specified  format,  which takes the same format as
                            the template argument to strftime(3). Supports the
                            same   extension   for  sub-second  resolution  as
                            %d{...}.

                     ·      %E : The hostname of the node running the applica‐
                            tion.

                     ·      %m : The message being logged.

                     ·      %N  : A serial number for this message within this
                            run of the program, as a decimal number. The first
                            message  a  program  logs has serial number 1, the
                            second one has serial number 2, and so on.

                     ·      %n : A new-line.

                     ·      %p : The level at which  the  message  is  logged,
                            e.g. DBG.

                     ·      %P  : The program’s process ID (pid), as a decimal
                            number.

                     ·      %r : The number of milliseconds elapsed  from  the
                            start  of  the application to the time the message
                            was logged.

                     ·      %t : The subprogram name, that is, an  identifying
                            name  for  the  process or thread that emitted the
                            log message, such as monitor for the process  used
                            for  -monitor  or  main for the primary process or
                            thread in a program.

                     ·      %T : The subprogram name enclosed in  parentheses,
                            e.g.  (monitor),  or the empty string for the pri‐
                            mary process or thread in a program.

                     ·      %% : A literal %.

                     A few options may appear between the  %  and  the  format
                     specifier character, in this order:

                     ·      - : Left justify the escape’s expansion within its
                            field width. Right justification is the default.

                     ·      - : Pad the field to the field width with 0s. Pad‐
                            ding with spaces is the default.

                     width  A number specifies the minimum field width. If the
                     escape expands to fewer characters than width then it  is
                     padded to fill the field width. (A field wider than width
                     is not truncated to fit.)

                     The default  pattern  for  console  and  file  output  is
                     %D{%Y-%m-%dT %H:%M:%SZ}|%05N|%c|%p|%m; for syslog output,
                     %05N|%c|%p|%m.

              vlog/set FACILITY:facility
                     Sets the RFC5424 facility of the  log  message.  facility
                     can  be  one  of  kern, user, mail, daemon, auth, syslog,
                     lpr, news, uucp, clock, ftp, ntp, audit,  alert,  clock2,
                     local0, local1, local2, local3, local4, local5, local6 or
                     local7.

              vlog/close
                     Causes the daemon to close its log file, if it  is  open.
                     (Use vlog/reopen to reopen it later.)

              vlog/reopen
                     Causes  the  daemon to close its log file, if it is open,
                     and then reopen it. (This is useful  after  rotating  log
                     files, to cause a new log file to be used.)

                     This  has  no  effect  if  the target application was not
                     invoked with the --log-file option.

OPTIONS
       -h
       --help
            Prints a brief help message to the console.

       -V
       --version
            Prints version information to the console.
