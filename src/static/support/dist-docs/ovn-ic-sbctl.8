ovn-ic-sbctl \- Open Virtual Network interconnection southbound db management utility
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBovn\-ic\-sbctl\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIcommand\fR [\fIarg\fR\[char46]\[char46]\[char46]]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
.PP
This utility can be used to manage the OVN interconnection southbound database\[char46]
.SH "GENERAL COMMANDS"
.TP
\fBinit\fR
Initializes the database, if it is empty\[char46] If the database has already been initialized, this command has no effect\[char46]
.TP
\fBshow [\fIavailability_zone\fB]\fR
Prints a brief overview of the database contents\[char46] If \fIavailability_zone\fR is provided, only records related to that availability zone are shown\[char46]
.SH "DATABASE COMMANDS"
.PP
.PP
These commands query and modify the contents of \fBovsdb\fR tables\[char46] They are a slight abstraction of the \fBovsdb\fR interface and as such they operate at a lower level than other \fBovn\-ic\-sbctl\fR commands\[char46]
.PP
\fIIdentifying Tables, Records, and Columns\fR
.PP
.PP
Each of these commands has a \fItable\fR parameter to identify a table within the database\[char46] Many of them also take a \fIrecord\fR parameter that identifies a particular record within a table\[char46] The \fIrecord\fR parameter may be the UUID for a record, which may be abbreviated to its first 4 (or more) hex digits, as long as that is unique\[char46] Many tables offer additional ways to identify records\[char46] Some commands also take \fIcolumn\fR parameters that identify a particular field within the records in a table\[char46]
.PP
.PP
For a list of tables and their columns, see \fBovn\-ic\-sb\fR(5) or see the table listing from the \fB\-\-help\fR option\[char46]
.PP
.PP
Record names must be specified in full and with correct capitalization, except that UUIDs may be abbreviated to their first 4 (or more) hex digits, as long as that is unique within the table\[char46] Names of tables and columns are not case-sensitive, and \fB\-\fR and \fB_\fR are treated interchangeably\[char46] Unique abbreviations of table and column names are acceptable, e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBg\fR or \fBgatew\fR is sufficient to identify the \fBGateway\fR table\[char46]
.PP
.PP
.PP
\fIDatabase Values\fR
.PP
.PP
Each column in the database accepts a fixed type of data\[char46] The currently defined basic types, and their representations, are:
.RS
.TP
integer
A decimal integer in the range \-2**63 to 2**63\-1, inclusive\[char46]
.TP
real
A floating-point number\[char46]
.TP
Boolean
True or false, written \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR, respectively\[char46]
.TP
string
An arbitrary Unicode string, except that null bytes are not allowed\[char46] Quotes are optional for most strings that begin with an English letter or underscore and consist only of letters, underscores, hyphens, and periods\[char46] However, \fBtrue\fR and \fBfalse\fR and strings that match the syntax of UUIDs (see below) must be enclosed in double quotes to distinguish them from other basic types\[char46] When double quotes are used, the syntax is that of strings in JSON, e\[char46]g\[char46] backslashes may be used to escape special characters\[char46] The empty string must be represented as a pair of double quotes (\fB\(dq\(dq\fR)\[char46]
.TP
UUID
Either a universally unique identifier in the style of RFC 4122, e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBf81d4fae\-7dec\-11d0\-a765\-00a0c91e6bf6\fR, or an \fB@\fR\fIname\fR defined by a \fBget\fR or \fBcreate\fR command within the same \fBovs\-vsctl\fR invocation\[char46]
.RE
.PP
.PP
Multiple values in a single column may be separated by spaces or a single comma\[char46] When multiple values are present, duplicates are not allowed, and order is not important\[char46] Conversely, some database columns can have an empty set of values, represented as \fB[]\fR, and square brackets may optionally enclose other non-empty sets or single values as well\[char46]
.PP
.PP
A few database columns are ``maps\(cq\(cq of key-value pairs, where the key and the value are each some fixed database type\[char46] These are specified in the form \fIkey\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR, where \fIkey\fR and \fIvalue\fR follow the syntax for the column\(cqs key type and value type, respectively\[char46] When multiple pairs are present (separated by spaces or a comma), duplicate keys are not allowed, and again the order is not important\[char46] Duplicate values are allowed\[char46] An empty map is represented as \fB{}\fR\[char46] Curly braces may optionally enclose non-empty maps as well (but use quotes to prevent the shell from expanding \fBother\-config={0=x,1=y}\fR into \fBother\-config=0=x
other\-config=1=y\fR, which may not have the desired effect)\[char46]

Without \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, it is an error if any specified \fIrecord\fR does not exist\[char46] With \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, the command ignores any \fIrecord\fR that does not exist, without producing any output\[char46]

Lists the data in each record in \fItable\fR whose \fIcolumn\fR equals \fIvalue\fR or, if \fIkey\fR is specified, whose \fIcolumn\fR contains a \fIkey\fR with the specified \fIvalue\fR\[char46] The following operators may be used where \fB=\fR is written in the syntax summary:
.RS
.TP
\fB= != < > <= >=\fR
Selects records in which \fIcolumn\fR[\fB:\fR\fIkey\fR] equals, does not equal, is less than, is greater than, is less than or equal to, or is greater than or equal to \fIvalue\fR, respectively\[char46]
.IP
Consider \fIcolumn\fR[\fB:\fR\fIkey\fR] and \fIvalue\fR as sets of elements\[char46] Identical sets are considered equal\[char46] Otherwise, if the sets have different numbers of elements, then the set with more elements is considered to be larger\[char46] Otherwise, consider a element from each set pairwise, in increasing order within each set\[char46] The first pair that differs determines the result\[char46] (For a column that contains key-value pairs, first all the keys are compared, and values are considered only if the two sets contain identical keys\[char46])
.TP
\fB{=} {!=}\fR
Test for set equality or inequality, respectively\[char46]
.TP
\fB{<=}\fR
Selects records in which \fIcolumn\fR[\fB:\fR\fIkey\fR] is a subset of \fIvalue\fR\[char46] For example, \fBflood\-vlans{<=}1,2\fR selects records in which the \fBflood\-vlans\fR column is the empty set or contains 1 or 2 or both\[char46]
.TP
\fB{<}\fR
Selects records in which \fIcolumn\fR[\fB:\fR\fIkey\fR] is a proper subset of \fIvalue\fR\[char46] For example, \fBflood\-vlans{<}1,2\fR selects records in which the \fBflood\-vlans\fR column is the empty set or contains 1 or 2 but not both\[char46]
.TP
\fB{>=} {>}\fR
Same as \fB{<=}\fR and \fB{<}\fR, respectively, except that the relationship is reversed\[char46] For example, \fBflood\-vlans{>=}1,2\fR selects records in which the \fBflood\-vlans\fR column contains both 1 and 2\[char46]
.RE
.IP
For arithmetic operators (\fB= != < > <= >=\fR), when \fIkey\fR is specified but a particular record\(cqs \fIcolumn\fR does not contain \fIkey\fR, the record is always omitted from the results\[char46] Thus, the condition \fBother\-config:mtu!=1500\fR matches records that have a \fBmtu\fR key whose value is not 1500, but not those that lack an \fBmtu\fR key\[char46]
.IP
For the set operators, when \fIkey\fR is specified but a particular record\(cqs \fIcolumn\fR does not contain \fIkey\fR, the comparison is done against an empty set\[char46] Thus, the condition \fBother\-config:mtu{!=}1500\fR matches records that have a \fBmtu\fR key whose value is not 1500 and those that lack an \fBmtu\fR key\[char46]

Prints the value of each specified \fIcolumn\fR in the given \fIrecord\fR in \fItable\fR\[char46] For map columns, a \fIkey\fR may optionally be specified, in which case the value associated with \fIkey\fR in the column is printed, instead of the entire map\[char46]
.IP
Without \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, it is an error if \fIrecord\fR does not exist or \fIkey\fR is specified, if \fIkey\fR does not exist in \fIrecord\fR\[char46] With \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, a missing \fIrecord\fR yields no output and a missing \fIkey\fR prints a blank line\[char46]
.IP
If \fB@\fR\fIname\fR is specified, then the UUID for \fIrecord\fR may be referred to by that name later in the same \fBovs\-vsctl\fR invocation in contexts where a UUID is expected\[char46]
.IP
Both \fB\-\-id\fR and the \fIcolumn\fR arguments are optional, but usually at least one or the other should be specified\[char46] If both are omitted, then \fBget\fR has no effect except to verify that \fIrecord\fR exists in \fItable\fR\[char46]

\fB\-\-id\fR and \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR cannot be used together\[char46]
.TP
[\fB\-\-if\-exists\fR] \fBset\fR \fItable record column\fR[\fB:\fR\fIkey\fR]\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR\[char46]\[char46]\[char46]
Sets the value of each specified \fIcolumn\fR in the given \fIrecord\fR in \fItable\fR to \fIvalue\fR\[char46] For map columns, a \fIkey\fR may optionally be specified, in which case the value associated with \fIkey\fR in that column is changed (or added, if none exists), instead of the entire map\[char46]
.IP
Without \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, it is an error if \fIrecord\fR does not exist\[char46] With \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, this command does nothing if \fIrecord\fR does not exist\[char46]
.TP
[\fB\-\-if\-exists\fR] \fBadd\fR \fItable record column\fR [\fIkey\fR\fB=\fR]\fIvalue\fR\[char46]\[char46]\[char46]
Adds the specified value or key-value pair to \fIcolumn\fR in \fIrecord\fR in \fItable\fR\[char46] If \fIcolumn\fR is a map, then \fIkey\fR is required, otherwise it is prohibited\[char46] If \fIkey\fR already exists in a map column, then the current \fIvalue\fR is not replaced (use the \fBset\fR command to replace an existing value)\[char46]

[\fB\-\-if\-exists\fR] \fBremove\fR \fItable record column key\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR\[char46]\[char46]\[char46]
Removes the specified values or key-value pairs from \fIcolumn\fR in \fIrecord\fR in \fItable\fR\[char46] The first form applies to columns that are not maps: each specified \fIvalue\fR is removed from the column\[char46] The second and third forms apply to map columns: if only a \fIkey\fR is specified, then any key-value pair with the given \fIkey\fR is removed, regardless of its value; if a \fIvalue\fR is given then a pair is removed only if both key and value match\[char46]

[\fB\-\-id=@\fR\fIname\fR] \fBcreate\fR \fItable column\fR[\fB:\fR\fIkey\fR]\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR\[char46]\[char46]\[char46]
Creates a new record in \fItable\fR and sets the initial values of each \fIcolumn\fR\[char46] Columns not explicitly set will receive their default values\[char46] Outputs the UUID of the new row\[char46]
.IP
If \fB@\fR\fIname\fR is specified, then the UUID for the new row may be referred to by that name elsewhere in the same \fB\e*(PN\fR invocation in contexts where a UUID is expected\[char46] Such references may precede or follow the \fBcreate\fR command\[char46]

Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)
Records in the Open vSwitch database are significant only when they can be reached directly or indirectly from the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table\[char46] Except for records in the \fBQoS\fR or \fBQueue\fR tables, records that are not reachable from the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table are automatically deleted from the database\[char46] This deletion happens immediately, without waiting for additional \fBovs\-vsctl\fR commands or other database activity\[char46] Thus, a \fBcreate\fR command must generally be accompanied by additional commands \fIwithin the same\fR \fBovs\-vsctl\fR \fIinvocation\fR to add a chain of references to the newly created record from the top-level \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR record\[char46] The \fBEXAMPLES\fR section gives some examples that show how to do this\[char46]

.TP
\fB\-\-all destroy\fR \fItable\fR
Deletes all records from the \fItable\fR\[char46]
.RS
.TP
Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)
The \fBdestroy\fR command is only useful for records in the \fBQoS\fR or \fBQueue\fR tables\[char46] Records in other tables are automatically deleted from the database when they become unreachable from the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table\[char46] This means that deleting the last reference to a record is sufficient for deleting the record itself\[char46] For records in these tables, \fBdestroy\fR is silently ignored\[char46] See the \fBEXAMPLES\fR section below for more information\[char46]

.TP
\fBwait\-until\fR \fItable record\fR [\fIcolumn\fR[\fB:\fR\fIkey\fR]\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR]\[char46]\[char46]\[char46]
Waits until \fItable\fR contains a record named \fIrecord\fR whose \fIcolumn\fR equals \fIvalue\fR or, if \fIkey\fR is specified, whose \fIcolumn\fR contains a \fIkey\fR with the specified \fIvalue\fR\[char46] Any of the operators \fB!=\fR, \fB<\fR, \fB>\fR, \fB<=\fR, or \fB>=\fR may be substituted for \fB=\fR to test for inequality, less than, greater than, less than or equal to, or greater than or equal to, respectively\[char46] (Don\(cqt forget to escape \fB<\fR or \fB>\fR from interpretation by the shell\[char46])

If no \fIcolumn\fR[\fB:\fR\fIkey\fR]\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR arguments are given, this command waits only until \fIrecord\fR exists\[char46] If more than one such argument is given, the command waits until all of them are satisfied\[char46]
.RS

Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)
Usually \fBwait\-until\fR should be placed at the beginning of a set of \fBovs\-vsctl\fR commands\[char46] For example, \fBwait\-until bridge br0
\-\- get bridge br0 datapath_id\fR waits until a bridge named \fBbr0\fR is created, then prints its \fBdatapath_id\fR column, whereas \fBget bridge br0 datapath_id \-\- wait\-until bridge br0\fR will abort if no bridge named \fBbr0\fR exists when \fBovs\-vsctl\fR initially connects to the database\[char46]

\fB\-\-no\-leader\-only\fR
By default, or with \fB\-\-leader\-only\fR, when the database server is a clustered database, \fBovn\-ic\-sbctl\fR will avoid servers other than the cluster leader\[char46] This ensures that any data that \fBovn\-ic\-sbctl\fR reads and reports is up-to-date\[char46] With \fB\-\-no\-leader\-only\fR, \fBovn\-ic\-sbctl\fR will use any server in the cluster, which means that for read-only transactions it can report and act on stale data (transactions that modify the database are always serialized even with \fB\-\-no\-leader\-only\fR)\[char46] Refer to \fBUnderstanding Cluster Consistency\fR in \fBovsdb\fR(7) for more information\[char46]

.TP
\fBtable\fR
2-D text tables with aligned columns\[char46]
.TP
\fBlist\fR (default)
A list with one column per line and rows separated by a blank line\[char46]
.TP
\fBhtml\fR
HTML tables\[char46]
.TP
\fBcsv\fR
Comma-separated values as defined in RFC 4180\[char46]
.TP
\fBjson\fR
JSON format as defined in RFC 4627\[char46] The output is a sequence of JSON objects, each of which corresponds to one table\[char46] Each JSON object has the following members with the noted values:
.RS
.TP
\fBcaption\fR
The table\(cqs caption\[char46] This member is omitted if the table has no caption\[char46]
.TP
\fBheadings\fR
An array with one element per table column\[char46] Each array element is a string giving the corresponding column\(cqs heading\[char46]
.TP
\fBdata\fR
An array with one element per table row\[char46] Each element is also an array with one element per table column\[char46] The elements of this second-level array are the cells that constitute the table\[char46] Cells that represent OVSDB data or data types are expressed in the format described in the OVSDB specification; other cells are simply expressed as text strings\[char46]

\fB\-\-data=\fR\fIformat\fR
Sets the formatting for cells within output tables unless the table format is set to \fBjson\fR, in which case \fBjson\fR formatting is always used when formatting cells\[char46] The following types of \fIformat\fR are available:
.RS
.TP
\fBstring\fR (default)
The simple format described in the \fBDatabase Values\fR section of \fBovs\-vsctl\fR(8)\[char46]
.TP
\fBbare\fR
The simple format with punctuation stripped off: \fB[]\fR and \fB{}\fR are omitted around sets, maps, and empty columns, items within sets and maps are space-separated, and strings are never quoted\[char46] This format may be easier for scripts to parse\[char46]
.TP
\fBjson\fR
The RFC 4627 JSON format as described above\[char46]
.RE
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-headings\fR
This option suppresses the heading row that otherwise appears in the first row of table output\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-\-pretty\fR
By default, JSON in output is printed as compactly as possible\[char46] This option causes JSON in output to be printed in a more readable fashion\[char46] Members of objects and elements of arrays are printed one per line, with indentation\[char46]
.IP
This option does not affect JSON in tables, which is always printed compactly\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-\-bare\fR
Equivalent to \fB\-\-format=list \-\-data=bare \-\-no\-headings\fR\[char46]

PKI configuration is required to use SSL for the connection to the database\[char46]
.RS
.TP
\fB\-p\fR \fIprivkey\[char46]pem\fR
.TQ .5in
\fB\-\-private\-key=\fR\fIprivkey\[char46]pem\fR
Specifies a PEM file containing the private key used as identity for outgoing SSL connections\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fIcert\[char46]pem\fR
.TQ .5in
\fB\-\-certificate=\fR\fIcert\[char46]pem\fR
Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies the private key specified on \fB\-p\fR or \fB\-\-private\-key\fR to be trustworthy\[char46] The certificate must be signed by the certificate authority (CA) that the peer in SSL connections will use to verify it\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-C\fR \fIcacert\[char46]pem\fR
.TQ .5in
\fB\-\-ca\-cert=\fR\fIcacert\[char46]pem\fR
Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate for verifying certificates presented to this program by SSL peers\[char46] (This may be the same certificate that SSL peers use to verify the certificate specified on \fB\-c\fR or \fB\-\-certificate\fR, or it may be a different one, depending on the PKI design in use\[char46])
.TP
\fB\-C none\fR
.TQ .5in
\fB\-\-ca\-cert=none\fR
Disables verification of certificates presented by SSL peers\[char46] This introduces a security risk, because it means that certificates cannot be verified to be those of known trusted hosts\[char46]
.RE
.RS
.TP
\fB\-\-bootstrap\-ca\-cert=\fR\fIcacert\[char46]pem\fR
When \fIcacert\[char46]pem\fR exists, this option has the same effect as \fB\-C\fR or \fB\-\-ca\-cert\fR\[char46] If it does not exist, then the executable will attempt to obtain the CA certificate from the SSL peer on its first SSL connection and save it to the named PEM file\[char46] If it is successful, it will immediately drop the connection and reconnect, and from then on all SSL connections must be authenticated by a certificate signed by the CA certificate thus obtained\[char46]
.IP
This option exposes the SSL connection to a man-in-the-middle attack obtaining the initial CA certificate, but it may be useful for bootstrapping\[char46]
.IP
This option is only useful if the SSL peer sends its CA certificate as part of the SSL certificate chain\[char46] The SSL protocol does not require the server to send the CA certificate\[char46]
.IP
This option is mutually exclusive with \fB\-C\fR and \fB\-\-ca\-cert\fR\[char46]
