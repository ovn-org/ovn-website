NAME
       ovn-controller-vtep  -  Open  Virtual Network local controller for vtep
       enabled physical switches.

SYNOPSIS
       ovn-controller-vtep   [options]   [--vtep-db=vtep-database]   [--ovnsb-
       db=ovnsb-database]

DESCRIPTION
       ovn-controller-vtep  is  the  local  controller daemon in OVN, the Open
       Virtual Network, for VTEP enabled physical switches. It connects up  to
       the  OVN  Southbound  database (see ovn-sb(5)) over the OVSDB protocol,
       and down to the VTEP database (see vtep(5)) over the OVSDB protocol.

   PKI Options
       PKI configuration is required in order to use SSL for  the  connections
       to the VTEP and Southbound databases.

              -p privkey.pem
              --private-key=privkey.pem
                   Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing the private key used as
                   identity for outgoing SSL connections.

              -c cert.pem
              --certificate=cert.pem
                   Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate  that  certi‐
                   fies the private key specified on -p or --private-key to be
                   trustworthy. The certificate must be signed by the certifi‐
                   cate  authority  (CA) that the peer in SSL connections will
                   use to verify it.

              -C cacert.pem
              --ca-cert=cacert.pem
                   Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate for ver‐
                   ifying certificates presented to this program by SSL peers.
                   (This may be the same certificate that  SSL  peers  use  to
                   verify the certificate specified on -c or --certificate, or
                   it may be a different one, depending on the PKI  design  in
                   use.)

              -C none
              --ca-cert=none
                   Disables  verification  of  certificates  presented  by SSL
                   peers. This introduces a security risk,  because  it  means
                   that  certificates  cannot be verified to be those of known
                   trusted hosts.

              --bootstrap-ca-cert=cacert.pem
                     When cacert.pem exists, this option has the  same  effect
                     as  -C  or --ca-cert. If it does not exist, then the exe‐
                     cutable will attempt to obtain the  CA  certificate  from
                     the  SSL  peer on its first SSL connection and save it to
                     the named PEM file. If it is successful, it will  immedi‐
                     ately drop the connection and reconnect, and from then on
                     all SSL connections must be authenticated by  a  certifi‐
                     cate signed by the CA certificate thus obtained.

                     This  option  exposes the SSL connection to a man-in-the-
                     middle attack obtaining the initial CA  certificate,  but
                     it may be useful for bootstrapping.

                     This  option  is only useful if the SSL peer sends its CA
                     certificate as part of the SSL certificate chain. The SSL
                     protocol  does not require the server to send the CA cer‐
                     tificate.

                     This option is mutually exclusive with -C and --ca-cert.

              --peer-ca-cert=peer-cacert.pem
                     Specifies a PEM file that contains one or more additional
                     certificates to send to SSL peers. peer-cacert.pem should
                     be the CA certificate used to sign the program’s own cer‐
                     tificate,  that  is,  the  certificate specified on -c or
                     --certificate. If  the  program’s  certificate  is  self-
                     signed,  then  --certificate  and  --peer-ca-cert  should
                     specify the same file.

                     This option is not useful in  normal  operation,  because
                     the SSL peer must already have the CA certificate for the
                     peer to have any confidence in  the  program’s  identity.
                     However,  this  offers  a  way  for a new installation to
                     bootstrap the CA certificate on its first SSL connection.

CONFIGURATION
       ovn-controller-vtep retrieves its configuration information  from  both
       the  ovnsb  and  the  vtep  database. If the database locations are not
       given from command line, the default is the db.sock  in  local  OVSDB’s
       ’run’  directory.  The datapath location must take one of the following
       forms:

              ·      ssl:host:port

                     The specified SSL port on the give host, which can either
                     be  a  DNS  name (if built with unbound library) or an IP
                     address (IPv4 or IPv6). If host is an IPv6 address,  then
                     wrap host with square brackets, e.g.: ssl:[::1]:6640. The
                     --private-key, --certificate and either of  --ca-cert  or
                     --bootstrap-ca-cert  options are mandatory when this form
                     is used.

              ·      tcp:host:port

                     Connect to the given TCP port on host, where host can  be
                     a  DNS name (if built with unbound library) or IP address
                     (IPv4 or IPv6). If host is an  IPv6  address,  then  wrap
                     host with square brackets, e.g.: tcp:[::1]:6640.

              ·      unix:file

                     On  POSIX, connect to the Unix domain server socket named
                     file.

                     On Windows, connect to a localhost TCP port  whose  value
                     is written in file.
