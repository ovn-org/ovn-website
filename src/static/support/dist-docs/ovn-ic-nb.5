.PP
.PP
This database is the interface for cloud management system (CMS), such as OpenStack, to configure OVN interconnection settings\[char46] The CMS produces almost all of the contents of the database\[char46] The \fBovn\-ic\fR program monitors the database contents, transforms it, and stores it into the \fBOVN_IC_Southbound\fR database\[char46]

We generally speak of ``the\(cq\(cq CMS, but one can imagine scenarios in which multiple CMSes manage different parts of OVN interconnection\[char46]

The specified SSL \fIport\fR on the host at the given \fIhost\fR, which can either be a DNS name (if built with unbound library) or an IP address\[char46] A valid SSL configuration must be provided when this form is used, this configuration can be specified via command-line options or the \fBSSL\fR table\[char46]

SSL support is an optional feature that is not always built as part of Open vSwitch\[char46]

Maximum number of milliseconds of idle time on connection to the client before sending an inactivity probe message\[char46] If Open vSwitch does not communicate with the client for the specified number of seconds, it will send a probe\[char46] If a response is not received for the same additional amount of time, Open vSwitch assumes the connection has been broken and attempts to reconnect\[char46] Default is implementation-specific\[char46] A value of 0 disables inactivity probes\[char46]
