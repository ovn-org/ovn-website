Name of a PEM file containing the CA certificate used to verify that the switch is connected to a trustworthy controller\[char46]
.IP "\fBbootstrap_ca_cert\fR: boolean"
If set to \fBtrue\fR, then Open vSwitch will attempt to obtain the CA certificate from the controller on its first SSL connection and save it to the named PEM file\[char46] If it is successful, it will immediately drop the connection and reconnect, and from then on all SSL connections must be authenticated by a certificate signed by the CA certificate thus obtained\[char46] \fBThis option exposes the
SSL connection to a man\-in\-the\-middle attack obtaining the initial
CA certificate\[char46]\fR It may still be useful for bootstrapping\[char46]
.IP "\fBssl_protocols\fR: string"
List of SSL protocols to be enabled for SSL connections\[char46] The default when this option is omitted is \fBTLSv1,TLSv1\[char46]1,TLSv1\[char46]2\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBssl_ciphers\fR: string"
List of ciphers (in OpenSSL cipher string format) to be supported for SSL connections\[char46] The default when this option is omitted is \fBHIGH:!aNULL:!MD5\fR\[char46]
.ST "Common Columns:"

The overall purpose of these columns is described under \fBCommon
